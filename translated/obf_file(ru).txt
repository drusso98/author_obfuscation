Chapter 1


Sir Walter Elliot of Kellinch Hall in Somersetshire was a man who:
for his own amusement he never took any books in his hands, except for the Baronetage; there
he found occupation for the hour of the holiday and consolation in the woe
one; there his abilities were admired and respected thanks to
consideration of a limited remainder of the earliest patents; anybody there
discomfort from household chores changed naturally
into pity and contempt as he turned over almost endless creations
last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he
could read my story with an interest that never failed.This
there was a page that always opened a favorite volume:

           "ELLIOT OF KELLINCH HALL."Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married July 15, 1784, Elizabeth,
James Stevenson's daughter, Esq..South Park County
Gloucester, by a woman (who died in 1800) gave birth to Elizabeth.
June 1, 1785; Anna was born on August 9, 1787; stillborn son, 5 November,
1789; Maria was born on November 20, 1791.."

This is exactly how the paragraph originally stood from the printed
Hands; but Sir Walter improved it by adding for information
himself and his family, these words, after the date of birth of Mary -
"Married on December 16, 1810 to Charles, son and heir to Charles Musgrove.
Esq.Uppercross in Somerset, "and adding most

Vanity was the beginning and end of Sir Walter Elliot's character;
the vanity of the person and the situation.He was remarkably handsome in
his youth; and at fifty-four he was still a very good man.Few women
could think more about their appearance than he and could not
the valet of any newly minted lord will be more pleased with the place he occupied
in society.He believed that the blessing of beauty was second only to
blessing of the baronetry; and Sir Walter Elliot, who united
these gifts were a constant object of his warmest respect and
devotion.His good looks and rank gave one just right to his affection; insofar as
to them he must have owed a wife of a very high character to any

or two personal disappointments in very unfounded claims),
prided himself on being single for his dear daughters.For
one daughter, his eldest, he would really give up everything,

only in Anna could she imagine that her mother was revived again.Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl a few years earlier, but her
flowering disappeared early; and, since even in his height, her father
did not find anything in her that could be admired (her tender
facial features and soft dark eyes from his own), in

never had much hope, now he had no hope that he would ever read her name in
any other page of his favorite work.All the equality of the union must
take a break with Elizabeth because Mary just tied herself to the old
country family of respectability and great fortune, and therefore
received all the honor and did not receive one: Elizabeth once or
the other, marry accordingly.Sometimes it happens that a woman at twenty-nine is prettier than she

Walter was looking for dating, and although his suggestions did not help

discount on the modest detachment of young people; and in one of its
spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was still in bloom, mister
Elliot was forced to enter.At the time, he was a very young man only studying
law; and Elizabeth found him extremely pleasant, and every plan in his
the favor has been confirmed.He was invited to Kellinch Hall; he was spoken
and the rest of the year is expected; but he never came.IN
the next spring he was seen again in the city, and he was considered just as pleasant,

immortalized by posterity, were overcome if he had not done worse;
but with him, as in the case of the usual intervention of good friends, they
were informed, talked about very disrespectfully, most
with disdain and contempt for the very blood to which he belonged, and
honors that were later to be his own.It couldn't be

Mr. Shepherd, a civilian, cautious lawyer who, no matter what he does,
or his views on Sir Walter, would rather that unpleasant
someone else, apologized at the slightest hint and
only asked permission to recommend an indirect reference to the excellent
judgment of Lady Russell, on the basis of whose common sense he completely
expected to be advised such drastic measures as he wanted to see
finally accepted.Lady Russell was very zealous in this matter and
very serious consideration.She was a sane woman rather than
quick ability, whose difficulty in making any decision in this
the specimens were excellent, from the confrontation of two guiding principles.She herself was distinguished by strict honesty and a subtle sense of honor;
but she was as eager to save Sir Walter's feelings as the caring
for the honor of the family, aristocratic in their ideas about what was
because of them, since any sane and decent person could well be.She was
benevolent, merciful, good woman and capable of strong affection,
the most correct in her behavior, strict in her ideas about decency and with
manners that were considered the standard of education.She had
developed mind and, generally speaking, rational and consistent;
but she had prejudices on the side of her ancestors; she was of value to
rank and significance, which somewhat blinded her from the shortcomings of those
who owned them.The widow herself is only a knight, she gave
the dignity of a baronet for all his dignity; and Sir Walter, regardless of his
declares that an old acquaintance, an attentive neighbor, helpful
landlord, husband of her very dear friend, Anna's father and
her sisters, like Sir Walter, in her opinion, had the right to
a lot of compassion and attention in his present
difficulties.They must retreat; there was no doubt about it.But she was very

outlining the downsizing scheme that was finally presented
Sir Walter.Anna's every amendment was on the side of honesty
against the importance.She wanted more drastic measures, more complete
reformation, faster debt relief, much higher tone

looking through her newspaper, "much can be done.If he accepts these
rules, in seven years it will be clear; and i hope we can

the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot is far from diminishing in
through the eyes of sane people, acting like a principled person.What will happen

feelings of a gentleman and head of the house, like your father,
there is even more because of the nature of an honest man."

This was the principle that Anna wanted her father to be

the expedition that could provide the most serious reductions,

Sir Walter will leave Kellinch Hall; and a few days later
doubts and indecision, the main question of where to go was
settled, and the first plan for this important change was.There were three alternatives: London, Bath, or another house in
country.All Anna's wishes were for the latter.Small house
in their own neighborhood where they may still have
society, still be close to Mary and still have fun sometimes
to see the lawns and groves of Kellinch was the goal of her
ambition.But Anna's usual fate accompanied her, in something
the exact opposite of her tendency, fixed on.She didn't like Bat, and
didn't think it was consistent with her; and Bath was to be her home.Sir Walter thought more of London at first; but Mr. Shepherd felt
that he could not be trusted in London, and he was skillful enough to
dissuade him from this and make Bat prefer.It was much safer
a place for a gentleman in his predicament: he could be important there
at a relatively low cost.Two material advantages of a bath over
London, of course, was given all the strength: it's more convenient

"I must get permission to observe, Sir Walter," said Mr. Shepherd.
in the morning at Kellinch Hall, when he put down the newspaper, "what

"He would be a very fortunate man, Shepherd," answered Sir Walter; "this is
all i have to note.Kellinch Hall would indeed have been a prize for him;
rather the greatest prize of all, let him take so much
before; hey shepherd? "

Mr. Shepherd laughed, knowing he must, at this wit, and then added:

"I propose to point out, Sir Walter, that with regard to business
the gentlemen of the navy do well with.I had a little
knowledge of their business methods; and I can confess
that they have very liberal views, and they are likely to
welcome tenants, just like any set of people to meet.Therefore, Sir Walter, I will allow myself to suggest that if

would think they should watch me; but sir walter elliot

applications will undoubtedly follow, I think that any of our

to add that two hours will bring me anytime to save you

Sir Walter just nodded.But soon after, getting up and pacing
room, ”he remarked sarcastically.

"I believe that few among the navy
don't be surprised if you find yourself in a house with such a description."

"They would no doubt look around and bless their luck."
said Mrs Clay, because Mrs Clay was present: her father brought her
there is nothing as good for Mrs Clay's health as a trip to
Kellinch: "but I totally agree with my father that a sailor could
be a very desirable tenant.I knew a lot about

you decide to leave them, it will be completely safe.All in and
the house will be taken care of so well! Gardens and
shrubs will be kept in almost the same order as they are now.You
no need to be afraid, Miss Elliot, that your sweet flower beds

“As for all this,” Sir Walter objected coolly, “if I was prompted

Here Anna said:

"I think the navy, which has done so much for us, has at least
equal rights with any other group of people, for all conveniences and for all
privileges that any home can give.Sailors work hard enough for their own
convenience, we should all allow."

"Quite true, very true.What Miss Anne says is absolutely true, said Mr
Shepard's answer, and “Oh! Of course, ”was his daughter's answer; but sir
Shortly thereafter, Walter said:

"The profession has its benefits, but I would be sorry to see
my friend belonging to him."

"Really!" was the answer, and with surprise in his eyes."Yes, this is offensive to me on two counts; I have two good reasons
objection to this.First, as a means of attracting faces

their fathers and grandfathers never dreamed; and secondly, how is it

we all know we were a village priest who had no bread; I was

name of heaven, who is this old man? I told my friend
who stood by (Sir Basil Morley).'Old comrade!' exclaimed sir
Basil, this is Admiral Baldwin..How old are you?
“Sixty,” I said, “maybe sixty-two..- Forty, - answered Sir Basil, -
forty and no more.“Imagine my amazement; I do not have
easy to forget Admiral Baldwin.I've never seen such a pitiful
an example of what marine life is capable of; but to some extent I know that it is
the same with all of them: they are all confused and exposed to
any climate and any weather until they become invisible.it
it is a pity that they were not hit immediately on the head, without reaching
Admiral Baldwin's age."

“No, Sir Walter,” exclaimed Mrs Clay, “this is really harsh..there is
some mercy for the poor.We are not all born to be beautiful.The sea, of course, does not decorate; sailors do age on time; I
watched it; they soon lose their youthful appearance.But then no
is it the same with many other professions, perhaps most others? Soldiers,
in the current service is no better: and even in a quieter

and travel in any weather; and even a priest ... "she stopped
a moment to think about what you could do for a clergyman; - "and even
the clergyman, as you know, is obliged to enter the infected rooms and expose
his health and everything looks harmful from the toxic atmosphere.IN
fact, as I have long been convinced, although each profession
in turn necessary and honorable, this is the lot of only those who
are not obliged to follow anyone who can live normally in
countries, choosing their own time, following their own pursuits and
live on your property without trying to achieve more;
I say that only their lot is to preserve the blessing of health and good
appearance to the limit: I do not know other people, except those who are losing
something of their personability when they cease to be very young."

It seemed that Mr. Shepherd, seeking to give his opinion of Sir Walter,
goodwill to a naval officer as a tenant, was gifted
foresight; after all, the very first application for a house was from
Admiral Croft, with whom he joined the company shortly thereafter in
attending quarterly sessions in Taunton; and indeed he got

his detailed description of himself, every proof that he

mentioned the place; and Ann, after a short pause that followed,
added--

"He is the rear admiral of the whites.He was in Trafalgar action,
and has since been in the East Indies; he was posted there, I
I guess several years."

“Then I take it for granted,” said Sir Walter, “that his face

Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him that Admiral Croft is very healthy,
a healthy, handsome man, though a little weathered, but not
many, and quite a gentleman in all his ideas and behavior; not

a cozy house, and get into it as soon as possible; knew he should

preferably as a tenant.He was married and childless; in
very condition to be desired.The house was never properly cared for, mister
The shepherd noticed without the lady: he did not know if there was furniture
may not be at such risk of suffering where there is no lady,
where there were many children.The lady without family was the most
the best furniture keeper in the world.He also saw Mrs. Croft;
she was in Taunton with the admiral and was present for almost everything
time when they discussed this issue."And she seemed like a very good, noble, perceptive lady,"
he continued; "asked more questions about home and timing, and
taxes than the admiral himself, and seemed more knowledgeable in
business; and what is more, Sir Walter, I have found that she is not quite
not connected in this country more than her husband; i.e,
she is the sister of a gentleman who once really lived among us; she told me
so she herself: the sister of a gentleman who lived a few years ago in
Monkford.Bless me! what was his name? At the moment I cannot
remember his name, although I heard it so recently.Penelope, mine
dear, could you please help me with the name of the gentleman who lived in
Monkford: Mrs. Croft's brother? "

But Mrs. Clay talked so enthusiastically with Miss Elliot that she did not
hear an appeal."I have no idea who you mean, shepherd; I don't remember
a gentleman who has resided in Monkford since the days of old Governor Trent."

"Bless me! How strange! I will soon forget my name, I suppose.The name with which I am so familiar; knew this gentleman so
good-looking; saw him a hundred times; came to me once to consult, I
remember the encroachment on one of his neighbors; farmer

fact; and subsequently, contrary to my opinion, filed in
peaceful compromise.Very strange indeed! "

After waiting another moment ...

"You mean Mr. Wentworth, I suppose?" said Ann.Mister Shepherd was grateful."Wentworth was the name itself! Mr. Wentworth was the man.He had

or three years.I arrived there for about a year --- 5, as I understand it.You

Sir Walter, without hesitation, declared the admiral in charge

and wanted to give her the opportunity to stay until she could
take her to Bath after Christmas; but with obligations
her own, which was to take her from Kellinch for several weeks, she was
unable to give the full invitation she desired, and Ann, although she feared
the possible heat of September in the whole white world of the Bath, and
grieving for giving up all such sweet and sad influence
autumn months in the country, did not think that everything
it is believed she wanted to stay.It would be the most correct and most
wise, and therefore must include the least suffering in order to walk with others.However, something happened that forced her to give her another responsibility..Mary, often

It was hardly a request to come to Uppercross Cottage and carry it
company for as long as she wants, instead of going to the bath.“I cannot do without Anna,” reasoned Mary; as well as
Elizabeth replied: “Then I’m sure that it would be better for Anna to stay so that no one
wants her in the bath."

To be declared as a commodity, albeit in an inappropriate style, at least
better than being rejected as useless; and ann, glad to be
thought of some application, glad that something was flagged as a duty, and
of course, it is not a pity to see this scene in the village, and her own
dear country, willingly agreed to stay.This invitation to Mary eliminated all of Lady Russell's difficulties, and
so it was soon decided that Anne should not go to Bath until
Lady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time must be
divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellinch Cottage.So far everything has been perfectly correct; but Lady Russell was almost overwhelmed

she could not apologize for trying to make it visible to her
sister.She had little hope of success; but Elizabeth, who is
the event of such a coup deserves much more regret than
she thought that she should never have reason to reproach her for
giving no warning.She spoke and seemed to only insult.Elizabeth could not understand how
such a ridiculous suspicion must have crossed her mind, and
for each side who knows their situation perfectly.“Mrs Clay,” she said warmly, “never forgets who she is; and since I

Ann did; glad it's over and not entirely hopeless
to do well.Elizabeth, though she resented the suspicion, could still be
made observant by this.The last task of the four carts was to attract Sir Walter,
Miss Elliot and Mrs Clay in the bath.The party left very well
perfume; Sir Walter bowed condescendingly to all
suffering tenants and summer residents who might hint
themselves, and Anna approached at the same time, in some deserted
tranquility, to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week.Her friend was not in a better mood than herself..Lady Russell felt

“I’m sorry that you’re not well,” Anne replied.."You sent me this

will go even though I told him how sick I am.He said he shouldn't stay
long; but he never came back and now almost alone.I

"Were your little boys with you?"

"Yes, as long as I could tolerate their noise; but they are so uncontrollable
that they do me more harm than good.Little Charles doesn't mind
the word I speak and Walter grows just as bad."

“Well, you’ll get better soon,” Anna replied cheerfully.."You

"I cannot give you an account of them.I haven't seen any of them

should know that my wish would be to stay with Lady Russell until
last: and besides what I felt about her, I really was like that
busy, I had so many things to do that I was not very comfortable
left Kellinch earlier."

"My God! What can you do?"

"A lot of things, I assure you.More than I can remember in
moment; but i can tell you something.I was making a duplicate
catalog of my father's books and paintings.I have been several times
in the garden with Mackenzie trying to understand and make him
understand which plant Elizabeth is for Lady Russell.I have
I needed to arrange all my little worries, books and music that needed to be shared,
and repack all my trunks, because I did not understand in time that

of a more difficult nature: to go to almost every house in the ward, because
a kind of vacation.I was told that they wanted it.But all of these
everything took a long time."

"Well!" and after a moment's pause "but you never asked me
one word about our dinner last night at Pools."

“You went then? I didn’t look around because I came to the conclusion that
had to give up the party."

"Oh yes! I went.I felt very good yesterday; nothing matters at all
with me until this morning.It would be strange if I didn't
passed."

"I am very glad that you were healthy enough, and I hope that you are well
a party."

"Nothing remarkable.It is always known in advance what the dinner will be
to be and who will be there; and it is very inconvenient not to have
own transportation.Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me and we were like that
crowded! They are both so big and take up so much space; and mr
Musgrove always sits in front.So I was wedged in the back
place with Henrietta and Louise; and I think it is very likely that mine
illness today may be because of this."

A little more persistence in patience and compulsion to cheerfulness.
Anna's side almost cured Mary..Soon she will be able to sit down
right on the couch, and began to hope that she could leave him
dinner time.Then, forgetting to think about it, she was on the other end
a room decorating a bouquet of flowers; then she ate her cold meat; as well as
then she was healthy enough to suggest a little walk."Where should we go?" she said when they were ready."I suppose you
will not want to go to the Big House until they have been to
you?"

"I have not the slightest objection to this," Anna replied.."I
should never think about standing in such a ceremony with people I know so much
well Mrs and Miss Musgroves."

"Oh! But they must call you as soon as possible.They have to
To feel what you owe as my sister.However, we can go
and sit with them for a while, and when this is over, we can
enjoy our walk."

Ann had always considered this style of communication to be very imprudent;
but she stopped trying to check it, believing that
although there were constant insults on each side, neither
the family could do without it now.To the Great House, respectively, they
went to sit for half an hour in the old-fashioned square living room,
with a small carpet and a shiny floor on which the daughters are present

look with surprise.The Musgroves, like their homes, were in a state of redevelopment,

good, their manners are calm and pleasant; they were of great importance
at home and loved ones abroad.Ann always saw them as some
from the happiest creations of her acquaintances; but still, saved as we are
all due to some comfortable feeling of superiority due to desire
the possibility of exchange, she would not give up her anymore
an elegant and developed mind for all its pleasures; and envied them
nothing but seemingly perfect understanding and agreement
together this good-natured mutual affection that she knew about
so little myself with one of my sisters.They were received very warmly..Nothing happened on
side of the Great House family, who were generally like Ann, very well

enough; and she was not at all surprised that in the end

fully occupied both houses in Kellinch for many weeks,
she expected more curiosity and sympathy than she found in
a separate but very similar remark by Mr and Mrs Musgrove: “So Miss
Ann, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and in which part of Bath are you
do you think they will settle? "And this, without waiting too much
respond; or in the addition of the young ladies: "I hope that we will be in
Bathhouse in winter; but remember daddy, if we go we should be in
good situation: none of your Royal Places for us! "Or in alarming
Supplement from Mary, oh - "Honestly, I'll be pretty well provided for,
when you are all gone to be happy in Bath! "

She could only decide to avoid such self-deception in the future and think
with heightened gratitude for the extraordinary blessing of having one
a sincerely sympathetic friend like Lady Russell.Mr. Musgroves had his own game to guard and destroy his own
horses, dogs and newspapers to attract them, and the females were completely
busy with all other common household items, neighbors,
dress, dance and music.She admitted that it fits very well,
that every small social community should dictate its own questions
discourse; and hoped to soon become a worthy member
the one she was transplanted into.With the prospect of spending on
at least two months in Uppercross, she had a lot of responsibility
clothe her imagination, her memory and all her ideas in
Uppercross if possible.She was not afraid of these two months.Mary was not so repulsive and
unfriendly, like Elizabeth, and inaccessible to her influence;
also there was nothing among the other constituent parts

brother-in-law; and in the children who loved her almost as much, and
respected her much more than their mother, she had an object
interest, entertainment and useful tension.Charles Musgrove was polite and accommodating; in sense and temperament he was
undoubtedly superior to his wife, but not in strength or conversation,
or grace to the past, since they were linked together, at all
dangerous contemplation; although, at the same time, Ann could believe
with Lady Russell that a more equal match could greatly improve
his; and that a woman of true understanding could give more
consequences for his character and more usefulness, rationality and
elegance to his habits and occupations.Anyway, he did nothing with
a lot of zeal, but sports; and his time was wasted without
benefit from books or something else.He was in a very good mood that
never seemed particularly moved by the occasional baseness of his wife
her unreasonableness is sometimes to the admiration of Anna, and on
in general, although very often there were small disagreements (in which she
sometimes had more share than she wanted, and both spoke to her
parties), they can pass for a happy couple.They have always been
absolutely agree with the desire to get more money and a strong desire
for a beautiful gift from his father; but here, as in most topics, he
had supremacy, since Mary considered it a great shame that such
they did not give a gift, he always claimed that his father
many other ways to use his money and the right to spend it at your own discretion.When it comes to managing their children, his theory was much better than
his wife's and his practice is not so bad."I could manage them very
well, if not for Mary's intervention "- that's what Ann often
heard him say and believed very much; but when listening
let's move on to Mary's reproach that “Charles spoils the children so that I
cannot put them in any order ", she never had the slightest temptation
say, "Quite right."

One of the least pleasant things about her stay here was that she
all parties have too much confidence in him, and
many secret complaints from every house.It is known that there is
influence on her sister, she was constantly asked, or at least,
getting hints to manifest it beyond what was practically feasible."I wish you
can convince Mary not always to think that she is sick, "
Charles language; and being unhappy, Mary said: “I do
believe me, if Charles saw that I was dying, he would not have thought that
anything with me.I'm sure Ann, if you could, you could
convincing him that I am really very sick - much worse than ever
own."

Mary's statement was: "I hate sending children to Great
House, although their grandmother always wants to see them because she
indulges and indulges them to such an extent, and gives them so much
trash and sweets that they will definitely return sick and angry
for the rest of the day."And Mrs. Musgrove took the first opportunity
be left alone with Ann to say, “Oh! Miss Ann I can't help but wish
Mrs. Charles had a bit of your method with these kids.They are
completely different creatures with you! But, of course, in general they
so spoiled! It's a shame you can't put your sister in the way
manage them.They are such wonderful healthy children like never before,
poor things! without addiction; but Mrs. Charles doesn't know anymore
how to handle them! Bless me! how unpleasant they are
sometimes.I assure you, Miss Ann, I don’t want to see them.
in our house as often as I should.I believe that Mrs. Charles
I'm not very happy with the fact that I don't invite them more often; but you know what it is
it is very bad to have children with someone who needs to be checked
every minute; "Don't do this" and "don't do this"; or what you can
just keep more cake in a bearable order than they need."

Moreover, she received this message from Maria.."Mrs Musgrove thinks
all her servants are so stubborn that it would be treason to cause her
question; but I am sure, without exaggeration, that her upper
a maid and a laundry instead of going about their business,
walk around the village, all day.I meet them wherever I go;
and declare that I never go twice to the nursery without seeing
some of them.If Jemima was not the most reliable, the most stable
a creature in the world, that would be enough to spoil her; because she says
I am always tempted to take a walk with them."And Mrs
On Musgrove's side, it was: “I have a rule of never interfering with any
the worries of my daughter-in-law, because I know it won't do; but I will
I'll tell you Miss Ann, because you might be able to clean up the mess,
that I do not have a very good opinion of the child maid Mrs.Charles: I heard
strange stories about her; she is always ready; and from my own
knowledge, I can declare that she is such a beautiful lady that she
enough to kill any servants she approaches.Mrs. Charles is cursing pretty
by her, I know; but i just give you this hint so you can be on
look; because if you see something wrong, you don't need to be afraid
mentioning this."

Again, this was Mary's complaint that Mrs Musgrove was very inclined not to
give her the edge she deserves when they dined at the Great
Home with other families; and she saw no reason why she was
reckoned so home that you lose your place.And one day
when Ann walked only with the Musgroves, one of them after
speaking of ranks, high-ranking people and rank envy, said: "I have no
bashfulness watching you how pointless some people are
your place, because the whole world knows how easy and indifferent you
about it; but I would like someone to hint Mary that this
it would be much better if she was not so stubborn, especially if
she will not always put herself in the place of mom.No one doubts her right to have an advantage over her mother, but that would be
it becomes more in her not always to insist on this.This is not true
mom cares about it least of all in the world, but i know it's busy
notification to many."

How did Anna solve all these questions? There was little she could do
more than listening patiently, softening every hurt, and forgiving everyone
other; give them all hints of the patience needed between
such closest neighbors, and make the hints that
for her sister.Otherwise, her visit began and went very well..Her
one's own mood is improved by changing the place and subject, by removing
three miles from Kellinch; Maria's illnesses have diminished thanks to
constant companion and their daily communication with another family,
since there was no higher affection, no confidence, no employment
in the cottage, being interrupted by this was rather an advantage.it
probably carried almost as far as possible, since they met everyone
morning, and almost never spent evenings apart; but she believed
they shouldn't have done so well without mr and mrs
Respectable Musgrove Forms With Or Without Ordinary Places
talk, laugh and sing to your daughters.She played much better than any of Miss Musgrove, but
without a voice, without knowing the harp and without loving parents to sit
besides, imagining herself delighted, her performance was not enough
just out of courtesy or to refresh others, because she felt good
aware.She knew that while playing, she only gave pleasure
herself; but this was not a new sensation.Except for one short period
her life, she has never, since the age of fourteen, never since
the loss of his dear mother, who knew the happiness of being heard, or
encouraged by any fair assessment or real taste.In music she had
always used to feeling lonely in this world; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove
affection for the activities of their daughters and complete
indifference to any other person, gave her much more pleasure for
for their sake than humiliation for her own sake.The party in the Big House was sometimes enlarged by another company..The area was small, but the Musgroves were visited
everything, and there were more dinner parties, and more callers, more visitors
by invitation and by chance than any other family.They were bigger
totally popular.The girls were crazy about dancing; and the evenings ended sometimes,
in an unintentional little ball.Inside was a family of cousins
a walk through Uppercross, in less favorable circumstances that depended on
Musgroves for all their pleasures: they come at any time,
and help to play anything or dance anywhere; and Ann, very
preferring the position of a musician to a more active position, played country
dance to them by the clock together; the kindness that always
recommended her musical ability to the attention of Mr and Mrs Musgrove
more than anything else and often made this compliment; - "Well done,
Miss Ann! really very well done! Lord bless me! how are these little
your fingers are flying! "

So the first three weeks passed.Mikhailovich came; and now Anna's heart
should be in Kellinch again.Favorite home passed on to others; everything
precious rooms and furniture, groves and vistas starting to own
other eyes and other limbs! She couldn't think of anything else on
September 29; and she had that sympathetic touch in the evening
from Mary, who, having indicated the day of the month,
exclaimed, "Darling, wasn’t this the day the Croft were supposed to come to
Kellinch? I'm glad I didn't think about it before.How low does it do
me!"

The Croft mastered with true naval vigilance and should have been
visited.Mary regretted the need."Nobody knew how
she must suffer a lot.She should put it off as long as possible ";
but it wasn't easy until she persuaded Charles to give her a ride
early in the morning, and was in a very busy, comfortable state
imaginary excitement when she returned.Anna is very sincere
was glad that she had no way to leave.However, she wanted
see the Croft, and was glad to be inside when the visit returned.They came: the owner of the house was not at home, but two
the sisters were together; and it so happened that Mrs. Croft fell
Anna's share, while the admiral sat next to Mary and tried very hard
pleasing to his good-natured remark about her little boys, she was healthy
able to observe the likeness, and if it fails in her facial features,
catch it by voice or by turns of sentiment and expression.Mrs. Croft, although she was neither tall nor fat, was square, straight,
and the vigor of the form that gave meaning to her personality.She had
bright dark eyes, good teeth and a generally pleasant face; though
her flushed and chapped complexion, a consequence of her
the fact that she spent almost as long at sea as her husband made her seem

about yourself, and no doubt about what to do; without any approach to
however rudeness or lack of good humor.Ann gave her credit
indeed, due to a sense of great respect for oneself in all
it was about Kellinch, and she liked it, especially because she
satisfied in the first half a minute, at the moment even
introduction that there was not the slightest sign of any knowledge
or suspicion on the part of Mrs Croft to give bias of any kind.She was
quite light in this head and therefore full of strength and courage,
until momentarily electrified by Mrs. Croft's sudden statement:

"It was you, not your sister, I believe that my brother had
the pleasure of dating when he was in this country."

Ann hoped she had survived the age of redness; but the age of emotion
she definitely didn't have."Perhaps you haven't heard that he is married?" added Mrs Croft.Now she could answer the way she should; and was happy to feel when Mrs
Croft's next words explained that it was Mr. Wentworth she was referring to:
that she didn’t say anything that she couldn’t do for her brother.She is
felt at once how reasonable it was that Mrs. Croft should be
think and talk about Edward, not Frederick; and with shame
on her own forgetfulness turned to the knowledge of them
the current state of the former neighbor with due interest.Otherwise, everything was calm; while they were moving, she
heard the admiral say to Mary:

"We are expecting Mrs. Croft's brother here soon; I dare say that you
know him by name."

He was interrupted by the impatient attacks of little boys who clung to

very keen on suggestions to carry them away in coat pockets,
& c.to have another moment to finish or remember what he had
began, Ann had to convince herself as best she could that
the same brother is still in question.However, she could not
achieve such a degree of confidence that you do not worry about
something was said about this in another house, where
Crofts previously called.The inhabitants of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day in
cottage; and now it is too late for such visits to
walk, the coaches began to listen when
the youngest Miss Musgrove entered..That she came to apologize
and that they should spend the evening alone was
first black idea; and Mary was ready to take offense when Louise
did everything right, saying that she only came on foot to leave more
harp room driven by carriage."And I'll tell you our reason," she added, "and all about it.".I
come on to warn you that dad and mom are out of sorts
evening, especially mommy; she thinks so much of poor Richard!
And we agreed that it would be better to have a harp because it seems to be entertaining
there is more of it than a forte piano.I'll tell you why she came out
perfume.When the Croft called this morning (they called here
then, right?), as it happened, they said that her brother,
Captain Wentworth has just been brought back to England, or paid, or
something, and comes to see them almost directly; and most
unfortunately, when they left, it occurred to my mother that
Wentworth or something called poor Richard.
the captain in due time; I do not know when and where, but for a very long time
before death, poor fellow! And looking at his letters and
things, she discovered that it was, and is quite sure that it should be
the same man, and her head is full of this, and poor Richard!
So, we need to be as funny as possible so that she doesn't get hung up on
such gloomy things."

The real circumstances of this pathetic episode in family history were as follows:
that Musgroves had the misfortune of a very unpleasant
hopeless son; and the happiness of losing him before he reached his
twentieth year; that he was sent to sea because he was stupid and
uncontrollable on the shore; that very little care was taken of him
the time spent by his family, although just as much as he deserved; rarely heard
and almost did not regret when the news of his death
abroad made his way to Uppercross, two years earlier.In fact, he did so, although his sisters were now doing their best to
he, calling him "poor Richard", was no better than
dull-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, never engaged in
anything that entitles itself to more than shortening its name,
dead or alive.He spent several years at sea and during these
displacements, which are the responsibility of all midshipmen, and especially such
the midshipmen every captain wants to get rid of, six months later

Under the influence of his captain he wrote to Laconia the only
two letters that his father and mother have ever received from him
during his entire absence; that is, only two
disinterested letters; everything else was just an application for
Money.In every letter he spoke well of his captain; but still so few
were they in the habit of paying attention to such matters, so unobserved and
they were partial to the names of people or ships that he made
almost no impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove should have
was suddenly startled, on the same day, with the recollection of the name
Wentworth, associated with her son, seemed to be one of those unusual
bursts of mind that sometimes happen.She looked through her letters and found everything as she expected; and
rereading these letters after such a long hiatus, her poor son
gone forever, and all the power of his mistakes is forgotten,
greatly influenced her mood and threw her into even greater grief due to
him than she knew when she first found out about his death.Mr. Musgrove was
to a lesser extent similarly affected; and when they reached
cottage, they obviously needed, first, to be heard again.

comrades could give them.Hear them talk so much about Captain Wentworth, repeating his name.

his arrival.The decision to do so helped shape the comfort of their evening..Chapter 7


A few more days, and it became known that Captain Wentworth was in
Kellinch and Mr. Musgrove came to him and returned warm in their
praise, and he was invited to dine at the Croft's at the Uppercross.
end of one more week.This was a big disappointment for Mr.
Musgrove found that an early day could not be corrected, so impatient was
he expressed his gratitude when he saw Captain Wentworth under his own
roof and welcoming him with all the strongest and best in his
cellars.But a week has to pass; only a week, according to Anna's calculations, and
then, she thought, they must meet; and soon she began to wish that she
could feel safe even for a week.Captain Wentworth returned very early to Mr. Musgrove's courtesy.
and she almost called there in the same half hour.She and Mary
were actually heading to the Big House, where, as she
later found out they had to find him when they were
stopped the older boy, who at that moment brought home
consequence of a bad fall.Baby situation staged a visit
completely aloof; but she could not hear indifferently about her escape,
even in the midst of the serious anxiety they subsequently experienced at
his account.His collarbone was found to be dislocated, and such an injury was sustained in
back, as it aroused the most disturbing thoughts.It was noon
disaster, and Ann had to do everything at once; pharmacist
send for, the father pursued and informed the mother to
support and keep from hysterics, control servants, junior
drive out the child, and look after and comfort the poor, suffering;
besides sending, as soon as she remembered it, proper notice
another house that brought her an introduction, rather frightened,
inquisitive comrades than very helpful helpers.Her brother's return was the first consolation; he could take care of
his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the pharmacist.Until he came and examined the child, their fears were
worse from vagueness; they suspected serious injury but did not know where;
but now the collarbone was soon replaced, and although Mr Robinson felt
and felt, and rubbed, and looked serious, and said quiet words to both
father and aunt, yet they all had to hope for the best and be
able to part and eat their lunch in tolerable ease; and then
just before they parted, the two young aunts were able to
far from their nephew's condition to report
Captain Wentworth's visit; staying five minutes behind his father and
mother to try to express how completely satisfied they were
he is, how much more beautiful, how infinitely more pleasant they thought him
than any of their male acquaintances who have ever been
favorite before.How glad they were to hear how dad invited him to
stay for dinner, what a pity when he said that it was completely beyond his power, and
how happy he was again when he promised in response to dad and mom
further insistent invitations to come and dine with them at
tomorrow - tomorrow; and he promised it in such a pleasant
demeanor, as if he felt the whole motive of their attention as well as
should.In short, he looked at everything and said with such
exquisite grace that they could assure them all, their heads were both
addressed to him; and they ran full of glee and love, and
obviously more filled with Captain Wentworth than little Charles..The same story and the same raptures were repeated when two girls
came with their father through the dusk of the evening to do
requests; and Mr. Musgrove, no longer worried about
his heir, might add his confirmation and praise, and hope that
to be no longer a reason to alienate Captain Wentworth, and I'm only sorry
think that the dacha probably won't want to leave

boy "both father and mother were in too much anxiety.
carry a thought; and Ann, in the joy of escape, could not help
adding their warm protests to their.Charles Musgrove did show more inclination after that; "
the child was doing so well, and he so wanted to be introduced to
Captain Wentworth so he can join them tonight; is he
will not dine from home, but he can come in for half an hour."But
in this his wife fiercely opposed him, saying: “Oh, no, in fact,
Charles, I can't have you go away.Just think, if anything
should happen? "

Baby had a good night and everything was fine the next day.it

conclusion.The child was to be kept in bed and entertained as quietly as
possible; but what was the father to do? It was pretty
women’s business, and it would be highly absurd if he
use at home to shut up.His father really wanted him
meet Captain Wentworth, and there is no good reason to oppose
this, he must go; and it ended with him making a bold public
statement when he came from the shooting that he wants to get dressed
straight and dine in another house.“There is nothing better than a child,” he said; "so I told my
father, just now that I will come, and he considered me quite correct.Your sister is with you, my love, I have no doubt.You
would not like to leave it myself, but you see, I can be useless.Ann will send for me if something is wrong."

Husbands and wives usually understand when opposition will be in vain.Mary knew from Charles' manner of speaking that he was
determined to go, and that it is useless to tease him.She is
so he didn't say anything until he left the room, but as soon as
only Anna heard ...

"So, you and I will be left alone with this poor patient
child; and no creature comes close to us all evening! I knew how
it would be.It's always my luck.If there is anything
unpleasant actions of a man will always get out of this, and Charles
as bad as any of them.Very insensitive! I have to say this very
senselessness that he is running away from his poor little boy.Conversation
he's doing so well! How does he know that he is doing well,
or that in half an hour there can be no drastic change? I do not
think Charles would be so insensitive.So he must go
and enjoy myself, and since I am a poor mother, I cannot be
allow to mix; and yet I am sure I am more unusable than anyone else
to be about a child.That I am a mother is the reason why my
feelings shouldn't be felt.I'm not equal at all.Have you seen
how i was hysterical yesterday."

"But it was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm -
shock.You won't be hysterical again.I dare say that we will have
nothing grieves us.I perfectly understand the words of Mr. Robinson
directions, and don't be afraid; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder
your husband.The grooming does not belong to the man; it's not his
provinces.The sick child is always the mother's property: hers.
feelings usually do it like this."

"I hope that I love my child as much as any mother, but I do not know what
I am more useful in the ward than Charles, because I cannot
always scold and tease the poor child when he is sick; and you saw
this morning, if I tell him to be silent, he will definitely start
kicks.I have no nerves for such things."

"But would you please feel comfortable spending the whole
an evening away from the poor boy? "

“Yes, you see, his dad can, and why me? Jemima is so
careful; and she could tell us every hour as he.I am really
I think Charles might as well have told his father that we will all come.I
now little Charles worries me no more than he does.I was
terribly alarmed yesterday, but today is a completely different matter."

"Well, if you don't think it's too late to notify yourself,
Suppose you had to leave as well as your husband.Leave Little Charles
to my concern.Mr and Mrs Musgrove can't go wrong as long as I stay
with him."

"Are you serious?" exclaimed Mary, her eyes were shining."My God! This
very good thought, really very good.Surely I can just as well
go no, because I'm useless at home - right? and it only bothers me.You who have no maternal feelings are much better than anyone.
human.You can make little Charles do whatever; he always cares about you
in a word.It will be much better than leaving him alone with
Jemima.Oh! I will definitely go; I'm sure I should, if I can, just like
like Charles, because they really want me to get to know
Captain Wentworth and I know you don't mind being left alone.An
great idea of ​​yours, really, Ann.I'll go and tell Charles
and get ready now.You can send us, you know, at any time
notice if something is wrong; but I dare say that nothing will happen
alarm you.I wouldn't go, you can be sure if I didn't feel
quite calmly about my dear child."

The next moment she knocked on her husband's dressing room door,
and when Ann followed her up the stairs, she had time for everything
a conversation that began with Mary's words in a tone of great
jubilation -

"I want to go with you, Charles, because I'm no more use at home than
You.If I shut up forever with a baby I would
fail to convince him to do what he does not like.Ann will
stay; Ann commits to stay at home and take care of him.this is
Anna's own suggestion and so I will go with you which will be great
it's better because i haven't dined at another house since tuesday."

“This is a very kind Ann,” her husband replied, “and I should have been
very glad you left; but it seems rather difficult that it should be
stayed at home alone to feed our sick child."

Ann was now there to take on her own business, and her sincerity
manner, which was soon enough to convince him where the conviction
at least very nice, he no longer doubted that she was left
to dine alone, although he still wanted her to join them in the evening,
when the child could rest for the night, and kindly advised her
let him come and take her, but she could not be convinced; and this
in this case she very soon enjoyed seeing them set off
together in high spirits.She hoped they left to be happy
no matter how strange such happiness may look; as for her,
she is left with as much sense of comfort as she probably ever had
most likely will be her.She knew that she was the first to be useful to
child; and what could she care if Frederick Wentworth was only half
a mile, making yourself pleasing to others?

She would like to know how he felt about the meeting.maybe
indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances.It
should be indifferent or unwilling.Would he like to see her someday
again, he didn't have to wait until that time; he would do what
she could not help but believe that in his place she should have been for a long time
ago, when events were early, gave him an independence that only
wanted to.Her brother and sister returned, delighted with their new acquaintance,
and their visit in general.There was music, singing, talking,
laughter, it was all very pleasant; charming manners in the captain
Wentworth, no shyness or restraint; they all seemed to know each other
excellent, and the next morning he was going to shoot with
Charles.He should have come to breakfast, but not at the cottage.
it was suggested first; but then he was forced to come
instead to the Big House, and he seemed afraid to end up in Mrs.
Charles Musgrove's way because of the child and therefore
somehow, they didn't even know how it ended up with Charles meeting him
have breakfast at my father's.Ann got it.He wanted not to see her.He asked
after her, she discovered that little that could satisfy the previous neglect
acquaintance, as if admitting what she admitted,
perhaps with the same view of avoiding introductions when they
had to meet.The morning hours at the Cottage were always later than at
another house, and tomorrow the difference was so great that Mary
and Anne were no more than getting down to breakfast when Charles entered
they say that they have just left, that he has come for his dogs,
that his sisters followed Captain Wentworth; his sisters
intending to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth suggests
also wait for her for a few minutes, if this is not inconvenient; and although
Charles responded for the fact that the child is not in the same condition as he could.
make it uncomfortable, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without
his flight to notify.Mary, very pleased with such attention, was glad to receive
him, while a thousand feelings fell upon Anna, of which it was
the most comforting is that it will be over soon.And it ended soon.IN
two minutes after Charles' preparation, others appeared; they were
in the living room.Her gaze was half-met with that of Captain Wentworth, bow,
the curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he spoke to Mary, said it all
was right, said Miss Musgroves something, enough to mark a slight
support; the room seemed full, full of people and voices, but a few
minutes are over.Charles showed up through the window, everything was ready,
their guest bowed and left, Miss Musgroves also left,
suddenly deciding to go to the end of the village with
athletes: the room was cleared, and Anya could finish her breakfast
how could she."It's over! It's over!" she repeated to herself over and over again, in
nervous gratitude."The worst is over!"

Mary spoke but could not attend.She saw him.They had
met.They were in the same room again.Soon, however, she began to reason with herself and try to feel
less.It's been eight years, almost eight years since everything was
surrendered.How absurd to renew the excitement that is
the interval drove into the distance and fuzziness! What may not
eight years to do? Events of any description, change, alienation,
deletion - everything, everything should be contained in it, and oblivion of the past -
how natural, how definitely too! It included almost a third of her
own life.Alas! with all her reasoning, she found that to the restraining feelings

"Captain Wentworth is not very brave of you, Ann, although he was
attentive to me.Henrietta asked him what he thinks of you when they
left and he said, "You've changed so much that he shouldn't have known
it is you again.'"

Chapter 8


Since that time, Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot have repeatedly visited
the same circle.Soon they were having dinner together at Mr.
Musgrove, because the little boy's fortune could no longer provide for his aunt
under the pretext of absence; and that was just the beginning
other dinners and other meetings.The question of whether old feelings need to be revived must be understood.
evidence; the old days should undoubtedly be remembered
everyone; it was impossible not to return to them; the year of their engagement
could not help but be named by him, in small stories or descriptions
what conversation caused.His profession qualified him, his
disposition to lead him to talk; and "This was in the sixth year"; "What
happened before I went to sea in the sixth year ", happened during
the first evening they spent together, and although his voice did not sound
hesitates, and although she had no reason to believe that his gaze was wandering
to her, while he spoke, Ann felt a complete impossibility from her
knowing your mind that you can not visit it, remembering any
more than herself.There must be the same direct association
thought, although she was very far from the idea that it caused the same amount of pain.They had no conversation, no intercourse, except what
the most common courtesy is required.Once so many to each other! Now nothing!
There was a time when the whole big party filling now
living room in Uppercross, it would be very difficult for them
stop talking to each other.Except, perhaps, the Admiral
and Mrs Croft, who seemed especially attached and happy (Anne could
do not allow other exceptions, even among married couples),
There were no two such open hearts, there are no such similar tastes, there are no such feelings
in unison, no faces so beloved.Now they were like strangers;
no, worse than strangers because they could never get to know each other.it
there was eternal alienation.When he spoke, she heard the same voice and discerned the same mind.All naval affairs were almost always ignored.
a party; and he was asked a lot, especially two miss
Musgroves, who seemed to see no other than him, as
lifestyle on board, rules of the day, meals, opening hours, etc.., as well as
their surprise at his accounts, learning the degree of adaptation
and the arrangement, which was feasible, drew from it some pleasant
a sneer that reminded Anna of the early days when she too
ignorant, and she was also accused of considering sailors
live on board without food or a cook to cook it if
were, or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.From such reflections and hearings she was awakened by the whisper of Mrs.
Musgrove, overwhelmed with tender regrets, could not help but say:

"Oh! Miss Ann, if Heaven were pleased to spare my poor son, I dare
to say that he would be the same different by this time."

Anne suppressed a smile and listened affectionately, while Mrs Musgrove
eased her heart a little more; and therefore for a few minutes
did not keep up with the conversation of others.When she was able to let her attention take its natural course again, she
discovered that Miss Musgroves had just brought the fleet list (their own fleet
list, the first ever in Uppercross), and sitting down
together to study it, with the explicit purpose of finding out
ships commanded by Captain Wentworth."Your first asp was, I remember; we will be looking for an asp.."

"You won't find her there.Pretty worn out and broken.I was
the last person who commanded her.Then hardly fit for service.Suitability reported
for home service for a year or two and so I was sent to the West
Indie."

The girls looked in amazement.“The Admiralty,” he continued, “has fun from time to time.

can just as well sink to the bottom as not, they cannot
distinguish the set that is least likely to be missed."

"Fu! Fu!" exclaimed the admiral, "what the hell are these young people talking about!"
There has never been a better sloop than Asp in her days.For an old building
sloop, you would not see her equal.Lucky guy who got her! He knows
there must have been twenty men better than himself, claiming her in
in the same time.Lucky guy to get something so fast, nothing else

“I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you”; replied Captain Wentworth,
jokes aside."I was as pleased with my appointment as possible.
a wish.At that time it was a great pleasure for me to be at sea; but
very great facility, I wanted to do something."

"To make sure you did.What should such a young man do ashore?
half a year together? If a man did not have a wife, he would soon want
afloat again."

“But Captain Wentworth,” Louise exclaimed, “how upset you must have been.
when you came to Asp to see what kind of old thing you got."

“I knew very well who she was until that day”; he said smiling."I needed to make no more discoveries than you, in relation to
the fashion and strength of any old pelis you've seen
among half of your acquaintances since you can remember yourself, and who
finally, on some very wet day, it is given to yourself.Oh! she was dear

thinking aloud, "then he went to Laconia and there he met
with our poor boy.Charles, my dear, "(beckons him to her)", ask
Captain Wentworth, where he first met your poor brother.I
always forgot."

"It was in Gibraltar, mama, I know.Dick got sick in
Gibraltar, on the recommendation of its former captain to the captain
Wentworth."

"Oh! But Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he has nothing to fear
to mention poor Dick in front of me because it would be quite nice
Listen, such a good friend is talking about him."

Charles, somewhat more mindful of the likelihood of this incident,
just nodded and walked away.Now the girls were hunting Laconia; and Captain Wentworth could
indulge in the pleasure of taking a precious volume into your
with your own hands to get them out of trouble, and read aloud again
a statement about her name and rate, as well as about the current non-commissioned officer,
noticing that she was also one of man's best friends
ever had."Oh! Those were pleasant days when I had Laconia! How fast am I

the same luck in the Mediterranean."

“And I'm sure sir,” said Mrs Musgrove, “it was a good day for us,
when you were put as a captain on this ship.We will never forget that
you did."

Her feelings made her speak softly; and Captain Wentworth, hearing only in
part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove by his side,
looked pretty tense and looked forward to more.“My brother,” one of the girls whispered; "mom thinks about the poor
Richard."

"Poor dear fellow!" continued Mrs Musgrove; "he became so stable,
and such a great correspondent while he was under your care! Oh!
it would be nice if he never left you.I assure
you Captain Wentworth, we are so sorry he ever left you."

Captain Wentworth's face came to an expression for a moment.

mouth that convinced Ann that instead of sharing with Mrs Musgrove
good wishes as for her son, he probably tried his best to get

to be discovered by anyone who understood him less than herself; in another
at that moment he was completely collected and serious, and almost instantly
then he walked over to the sofa where he and Mrs Musgrove were sitting

her low voice about her son doing it with such compassion and
natural grace, showing the kindest attention to everything that was
real and unshakable in parental feelings.In fact, they were sitting on the same sofa, as Mrs. Musgrove readily
made room for him; only Mrs Musgrove shared them.Did not have

disaster as the most graceful set of limbs in the world.But honestly
or unfairly, there are unsuitable alliances, the reason for which

take advantage of.Admiral, making two or three refreshing turns around the room
with his hands behind his back, whom his wife had called to order, now approached
to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation that he could
to interrupt, thinking only of his own thoughts, he began with:

"If you were a week later in Lisbon, last spring, Frederic, you
would be asked to give passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her
daughters."

"Should I? I'm glad I haven't been in a week.."

The admiral insulted him for his lack of courage.He defended himself;
although he stated that he would never voluntarily admit any ladies to
board his ship, except for a ball or visit,
watch can understand.“But if I know myself,” he said, “it’s from a lack of gallantry.

Admiral, highly appreciating the claims of women for all personal comforts,
and this is what i do.I hate to hear about women on board or see
them on board; and no ship under my command will ever carry a family

It brought his sister to him."ABOUT! Frederick! But I can't believe this of you..- Everything is idling
sophistication! - Women can be as comfortable on board as in the best home
in England.I believe I have lived on board as long as most women, and
I don't know anything better than the conditions of a warship.I
declare that I receive no comfort or indulgence towards me, even when

most of the ships I have lived on; and there were only five of them."

“Nothing special,” her brother replied.."You lived with
your husband, and were the only woman on board."

"But you yourself brought Mrs. Harville, her sister, cousin and
three children, from Portsmouth to Plymouth.Where was it
then your superfine, extraordinary gallantry? "

"Everything merged into my friendship, Sofia.I would help any brother

I do not think this is evil in itself."

“I hope they were all perfectly comfortable.."

"Perhaps I will not like them, especially since it is possible.This amount
women and children are not allowed to feel comfortable on board."

"My dear Frederick, you speak rather idly.Pray that

“My feelings, you see, didn’t stop me from taking Mrs. Harville and all that.
her family in Plymouth."

"But I hate to hear you speak like a good gentleman, and as if
women were all beautiful ladies, not sentient beings.We are none of
we expect to be in calm waters all our days."

“Ah, my dear,” said the admiral, “when he has a wife, he will sing
another melody.When he's married, if we're lucky to live
to another war, we will see him do the same as you and I, and many
others did.We will be very grateful to him for the fact that
will bring him his wife."

"Yes, we will."

“Now I did,” exclaimed Captain Wentworth.."When people got married once
start attacking me with the words: “Oh! you will think differently when
Are you married.“I can only say:“ No, I will not ”; and then they say
again: "Yes, you will", and this is the end."

He got up and walked away."What a great traveler you must have been, ma'am!" said Mrs Musgrove
Mrs Croft."Very well, ma'am, in my fifteen years of marriage; although many
women have done more.I've crossed the Atlantic four times and
visited the East Indies once and returned again, and only once; Besides
be in different places at home: in Cork, Lisbon and Gibraltar..But I never went outside the Straights and I never went to the West
Indie.We do not call Bermuda or the Bahamas the West Indies.."

Mrs. Musgrove found nothing to disagree; she couldn't blame
herself for ever calling them something in all her time
a life.“And I assure you, ma'am,” Mrs. Croft continued, “that nothing can
exceed the capabilities of a warship; I say, you know, oh
higher rates.When you approach the frigate, you are certainly more
limited; although any reasonable woman can be perfectly happy in one of the

spent on board the ship.While we were together, you know, there was
nothing to be afraid.Thank God! I've always been blessed

frustration is always the first day of going to sea, but
never knew what kind of illness then.The only time I really
suffered in body or mind, the only time I ever imagined myself
unwell or had any thoughts of danger, it was a winter I spent
I was in Deal when the Admiral (then Captain Croft) was in the North
Seas.At the time, I lived in constant fear and
imaginary complaints of not knowing what to do with myself or when I
should hear from him next time; but as long as we could be together, nothing
ever hurt me and i never met the slightest inconvenience."

"Yes of course.Yes indeed, oh yes! I completely agree with your opinion,
Mrs. Croft, Mrs. Musgrove's hearty response.."There is nothing bad
as separation.I completely agree with your opinion.I know what this is for
Mr. Musgrove always goes to jury trials, and I'm very happy when they
ended and he's safe again."

The evening ended with dancing.When asked, Ann suggested
her services as usual; and although her eyes sometimes filled
tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely happy to be
hired, and desired nothing in return but to be unnoticed.It was a fun, joyous party, and no one seemed to be in high spirits than
Captain Wentworth.She felt that he had everything to lift him
whose general attention and reverence, and especially attention
all young women could do.Miss Hayters, women
already mentioned cousins, apparently, were admitted to
the honor of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louise, they
both seemed so preoccupied with him that nothing but continued
the manifestation of the most perfect goodwill among themselves could have
proved that they were not decisive rivals.If he was
little spoiled by such a universal, such impatient admiration, who could
be surprised?

These were some of the thoughts that occupied Ann while her fingers
mechanically worked, working together for half an hour,
equally without mistakes and without consciousness.One day she felt that
he looked at her, noticing her changed features, perhaps
trying to trace in them the ruins of a face that once fascinated
his; and one day she realized that he must have been talking about her; she was barely
realizing this until she heard the answer; but then she was sure of him
asking her partner, has Miss Elliot ever danced? Answer
was: "Oh no; never; she completely refused to dance.She is rather
play.She never gets tired of playing."Once he also spoke to her.She left the instrument at the end of the dance, and he sat down
down to try to make out the look he wanted to give miss
Musgroves idea.Inadvertently she returned to that part
number; he saw her and, instantly getting up, said with deliberate politeness:

“I beg your pardon, madam, this is your place”; and although she
retreated immediately with strong denial, he could not be prompted
sit down again.Anna did not want more such views and speeches..Its cold
politeness, his solemn grace was worst of all.Chapter 9


Captain Wentworth arrived at Kellinch as home, to remain there until
he loved being as much the subject of a fraternal admiral
kindness like from his wife.Upon arrival, he intended
very soon to move to Shropshire and visit his brother, who settled in
this country, but the sights of Uppercross prompted him to put it
off.There was so much friendliness, flattery and
there is all the most bewitching in his reception; old were so
hospitable, young, so pleasant that he could not help
stay where he was and take all the charms and perfection

in the morning, when he had no companion at home, the Admiral and Mrs
Croft used to walk together, wondering
their new possessions, their grass and their sheep, and mess around
in a way that is intolerable for a third party or by going to a concert,
recently added to their establishment.So far, there has only been one opinion of Captain Wentworth among
Musgroves and their dependencies.It was always warm admiration
everywhere; but this intimate support was nothing more than established,
when a certain Charles Hayter returned to them,
worried about this, and to think that Captain Wentworth is very disturbing.Charles Hayter was the eldest of all cousins ​​and very kind,
a pleasant young man, between whom and Henrietta were
a significant kind of affection that predates Captain Wentworth.

and when he returned, he found with difficulty the very changed manners,
and see Captain Wentworth.Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.Everyone had money, but
their marriages had a significant impact on their level of well-being.
consequence.Mr. Hayter had his own property, but it was
insignificant compared to Mr. Musgrove; and while the Musgroves were
in the first class of society in the country, young haters,
from the inadequate, secluded and uncouth lifestyle of their parents,
and their own incomplete education, almost never studied in any class
everything, but because of their connection with Uppercross, this eldest son, of course,
except who chose to be a scientist and a gentleman, and who was
very superior to everyone else in cultivation and manners.These two families have always had a great relationship,
pride on the one hand, and no envy on the other, and only such
the consciousness of Miss Musgroves' superiority that made them
happy to improve their cousins.Charles' Attention to Henrietta
were noticed by her father and mother without any judgment.“It wouldn't be a big party for her; but if Henrietta liked him, "
and Henrietta looks like he liked it.Henrietta had thought so herself before Captain Wentworth's arrival; but
since that time, cousin Charles has been greatly forgotten.Which of the two sisters did Captain Wentworth prefer?
it is highly doubtful how much of Anna's observation reached.Henrietta was
perhaps the most beautiful, Louise had a higher spirit; and she didn't know
now, was the more tender or livelier character the most
will probably attract him.Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove, either from little sight, or from the whole
confidence in the discretion of their daughters and everyone
the young people who approached them seemed to abandon everything to take their
chance.There was not the slightest sign of concern or comment.

the young couple were more inclined to reflect and wonder; as well as
Captain Wentworth has not been more than four or five times Miss
The Musgroves Company and Charles Hayter had just reappeared when
Anna had to listen to her brother and sister's opinion as to whether
which I liked the most.Charles gave it to Louise, Mary for
Henrietta, but quite agree that marrying him would be
extremely delicious.Charles "has never seen a more agreeable man in his life; and from the fact that he
once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that he
earned less than twenty thousand pounds in the war.That was
good luck immediately; besides, there is a chance that may
to be done in any future war; and he was sure that Captain Wentworth
probably a man to distinguish himself like any officer in the navy.Oh! it
would be the best match for any of his sisters."

"Honestly, there will be", - answered Mary.."My God! If he rises up to
very big honors! If he ever becomes a baronet! 'Lady
Wentworth sounds very good.It would be really noble for
Henrietta! Then she will take my place, but Henrietta will not.

creation, however, and I never think much of your new creations."

Mary was most suited to the thought of what Henrietta really prefers.
account of Charles Hayter, whose claims she wanted to see,
end to.She looked very determinedly at the Hayters and thought:
it would be a great misfortune to have an existing connection between
families have renewed themselves - very sad for themselves and their children.“You know,” she said, “I don’t think he’s at all suitable for
Henrietta; and given the alliances the Musgroves have made,
she has no right to rush away.I don't think any young woman
has the right to make choices that may be unpleasant and inconvenient
to the main body of her family, and have bad connections with
those who are not used to them.And pray who is Charles
Hayter? Nothing but the village priest.Worst match for a miss
Musgrove of Uppercross."

Her husband, however, disagreed with her here; Besides that
respecting his cousin, Charles Hayter was the eldest son and he saw
things like the eldest son himself.“Now you're talking nonsense, Mary,” so he replied.."It
wouldn't be Henrietta's best play, but Charles is very good

fifty acres, not counting the farm near Taunton, which is one of the best
land in the village.I agree that any of them, other than Charles,
to be a very shocking game for Henrietta, and it couldn't be; is he
the only thing that is possible; but he is very good-natured,
good guy; and whenever Winthrop falls into his hands, he
will make a different place out of him and will live in a completely different
a kind of way; and with this property he will never be despicable
man - good, unconditional possession.No no; Henrietta could have done worse than
marry Charles Hayter; and if she has it and Louise can get the captain
Wentworth, I will be very pleased."

“Charles can say whatever he wants,” Mary Ann shouted as soon as he
was not in the room, "but it would be a shock if Henrietta got married
Charles Hayter; it was very bad for her, and even worse for me; as well as
so I really wish that Captain Wentworth could soon

I like Louise as much as Henrietta, it’s stupid to say that; for him
of course loves Henrietta the most.But Charles is like that
positive! I wish you were with us yesterday because then you could
decided between us; and i'm sure you would think the same as me,
if you weren't in the mood to give it against me."

Lunch at Mr Musgrove's was the occasion when all these things
Ann was to be seen; but she stayed at home, under
mixed request for own headache and some return of malaise
in little Charles.She thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth;
but the ability to avoid going to a judge has now been added to
benefits of a quiet evening.As for Captain Wentworth's views, she considered it more important that
he must know his mind early enough not to endanger
the happiness of either a sister, or the impeachment of his own honor than what he
must prefer Henrietta to Louise or Louise to Henrietta.Either from
they, in all likelihood, will make him affectionate, good-natured
wife.As for Charles Hayter, she had a delicacy that should be
suffers from the frivolity of a well-meaning young woman, and
a heart to sympathize with any of the suffering they have caused; but if
Henrietta found herself wrong about the nature of her feelings,
the change could not be understood too early.Charles Hayter met many things that bothered and humiliated him in his
cousin behavior.She had been with him for too long to
as if alienated in two meetings extinguished all past hopes, and
leave him no choice but to stay away from Uppercross: but there
there was such a change that became very alarming when a person like the captain
Wentworth was to be seen as a probable cause.He was absent
only two Sundays, and when they parted, she remained interested, even
to the peak of his desire, in his perspective, soon to quit
real accuracy, and getting an Uppercross instead.Then it was
The closest thing to her heart was that Dr.Shirley, the rector,
more than forty years diligently performed all duties
his office, but now he was becoming too weak for many of them, he had to
be completely fixated on attracting kurat; should make its neatness the same
as good as he could afford and must give Charles Hayter a promise
it.The advantage that he only had to travel to Uppercross and not to
walk six miles the other way; that he is better in all respects

Shirley is relieved of a duty he could no longer fulfill
pass without the most pernicious fatigue, it took a lot, even to
Louise, but was almost everything to Henrietta.When he came
back, alas! zeal for business vanished.Louise couldn't
listen in general to his account of the conversation he had just had
with Dr. Shirley: she was at the window looking for the captain
Wentworth; and even Henrietta at best paid
to give, and seemed to have forgotten all the previous doubts and worries
negotiations."Well, I'm really very happy; but I always thought you were going to get it;
I always thought you were sure.It didn't seem to me, in short, you
you know Dr. Shirley must have a vicar and you kept his promise.Is he coming, Louise? "

One morning, very soon after supper at Musgroves, where Anne
was not present, Captain Wentworth entered the drawing room in
The cottage, where only she and the little invalid Charles were,
who was lying on the couch.Surprise, almost alone with Ann Elliot, is devoid of
his manner of usual composure: he shuddered and could only say:
"I thought Miss Musgrove was here: Mrs Musgrove told me that I
must find them here "before he went to the window to remember
yourself, and feel how he should behave."They are upstairs with my sister: they will go down in a few
moments, I dare say, was Ann replied, despite all the confusion,
it was natural; and if the child had not called her to come and do
something for him, she would have left the room the next moment,
and freed Captain Wentworth as well as herself.He continued at the window; and then calmly and politely saying: “I
I hope the boy is better ", - was silent..She had to kneel by the couch and stay there to satisfy
her patient; they went on like this for several minutes, when, in her opinion,
great satisfaction, she heard some other person cross the small
lobby.She hoped, turning her head, to see the master
House; but it turned out that it is much less designed for
easy - Charles Hayter is probably not at all happy with the spectacle
captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth at the sight of
Ann.She just tried to say, “How are you? Won't you sit down?
others will be here for now."

Captain Wentworth, however, came out of his window, apparently not
not inclined to talk; but Charles Hayter soon put an end
his attempts to sit down by the table and take
newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.Another minute brought another addition.Younger boy, wonderful

I do not like to go with them; and when Mary answered immediately, with some
jealousy of not being considered a good walker: "Oh, yes, I would like
to join you, I really love long walks, "Ann felt
convinced, by the appearance of two girls, that this is exactly what
they did not want and again admired the necessity that

unwanted and uncomfortable.She tried to dissuade Mary from going, but

she might be helpful to get back to her sister and reduce

Louise's speech that struck her.After one of many praises
the day that drew near, Captain Wentworth
added: -

“What wonderful weather for the admiral and my sister!
take a long trip this morning; perhaps we can greet them from some of
these hills.They talked about coming to this part of the country.I
wondering where they'll be upset today.Oh! it happens very much
often, I assure you; but my sister does nothing of it; she would like
I believe that you will be thrown out as not."

"Oh! I know you get the most out of this, ”Louise exclaimed,“ but if it were
really, I have to do the same in her place.If I loved a man
how she loves the admiral, I will always be with him, nothing should
someday tear us apart and I'd rather he turn me over than drive me out
safe by anyone else."

This was talked about with enthusiasm.."Have you been?" he exclaimed, catching the same tone; "I respect you!" And there
there was silence between them for a while.Anne couldn't get into the quote again right away.Sweetness

another half-mile of gradual ascent through the large enclosures, where
plows at work, and a fresh track said the farmer was opposing
the sweetness of poetic despondency and the intention to meet spring again,
they reached the top of the largest hill that divided
Uppercross and Winthrop and soon fully saw the latter,
at the foot of the hill on the other side.Winthrop, devoid of beauty and dignity, stretched out before them;
an indifferent house, standing low, surrounded by barns and
construction of a personal plot.Mary exclaimed: “Bless me! Here is Winthrop..I declare I had no idea!
Well, I think we'd better turn back; I am very tired."

was one of the points at which the lady showed her strength; and when
he recommended to rest a quarter of an hour at
Winthrop, feeling so tired, she replied firmly, “Oh no,
really! a second walk up the hill will hurt her more than any other
sitting could benefit her, "and, in short, her gaze and demeanor
said that she would not go.After a short series of such debates and consultations,
between Charles and his two sisters, it was decided that he and
Henrietta should just run away for a few minutes to see their aunt and
cousins ​​while the rest of the group waited for them at the top
Hill.Louise seemed to be the main organizer of the plan; and how is she

Mary took the opportunity, looking around contemptuously, and said:
Captain Wentworth ...

“It is very unpleasant to have such connections! But I assure you I

She got no other answer than an artificial, agreeable smile,
followed by a contemptuous look as he turned away that Ann
knew the meaning very well.On the ledge of the hill they stayed on was a fun place: Louise
returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable place on the step

about her; but when Louise took Captain Wentworth to try

better also.She turned into the same gate, but did not see it..Anne found a comfortable place for her on a dry, sunny beach, under
a hedge that she had no doubt that they were still in some place
or other.Mary sat down for a moment, but that didn't work; She was
sure Louise has found a better place elsewhere and she will continue
until she caught up with her.Ann, very tired, was glad to sit down; and she very soon
heard Captain Wentworth and Louise stand behind the hedge behind her, as if
returning down the rough, wild channel, down

first outstanding.She seemed to be at the center of an impatient
speech.First Ann heard ...

"So I made her go away.I couldn't bear the fact that she was scared
from visiting such nonsense.What kind! I would turn away from
to do what I decided to do and that I knew he was right,
by the sight and intervention of such a person or any person I can
to tell? No, I have no idea that I'm so easy to convince.When i have
decided I did it; and Henrietta seemed completely
figured out to stop by Winthrop today; and yet she was so close
abandoning it out of senseless complaisance! "

"Would she have turned back then if it hadn't been for you?"

"She really.I'm almost ashamed to say it."

“Glad for her that she has such a mind at hand!

After a moment's pause, Captain Wentworth said:

"You mean she turned him down?"

"Oh yes; of course."

"When did it happen?"

but I think that about a year before he married Mary.I wish she had

immensely happy: and they were devoted to each other almost from the very beginning
the first moment of their entry into Uppercross.Everything now distinguished Louise from Captain Wentworth; nothing could
keep it simple; and where many divisions were needed, or even where they
were not, they walked side by side in much the same way as the other two.IN
a long strip of meadow, where there was enough room for everyone, they
thus divided into three separate parties; and the other side
the three who had the least animation and the least agreeableness, Anne
necessarily belonged.She joined Charles and Mary and was tired
enough to rejoice in Charles's other hand; but Charles, although in
very good mood with her, I was not myself with my wife.Mary had
showed that she was disobedient to him, and now had to reap the benefits,
the consequence of which was that almost every moment he dropped her hand to cut
cut the ears of nettles from his whip in the hedge; and when
Mary began to complain about this and lament that she was poorly used.

everything.This long meadow bordered the lane along which their path passed, at the end
he had to cross, and when the whole group reached the exit gate,
the carriage was moving in the same direction as

and his wife drove the planned trip and returned home.Hearing how long the young people walked, they
kindly offered a place to any lady who might be especially tired; it
save her a mile and they walked through Uppercross.The invitation was general and usually refused..Miss Musgroves
were not at all tired, and Mary was offended that she was not asked
before anyone else, or what Louise called Elliot's pride, could

high and unjust indignation, although completely indifferent to her, and
although he was attached to another, he still did not see her suffer,
without wanting to give her relief.It was a remnant of the old
sentimentality; it was an impulse of pure, albeit unrecognized friendship;
it was proof of his warm and kind heart, which she could not
contemplate without emotion, so mixed with pleasure and pain that
she didn't know what prevailed.Her responses to the kindness and remarks of her comrades were on
first unconsciously given.They've come half way along

found them talking about "Frederick."

"He definitely wants to have one or the other of these two girls, Sophie."

pleasantly; "because if Miss Elliot heard how soon we got to

together.However, I knew you by nature long before."

begins to think about how this might affect her comfort.This will put her in the same village as Captain Wentworth, inside
half a mile from him; they would have to attend the same church, and
there must be intercourse between the two families.It was against
her; but on the other hand, he spent so much time in Uppercross,
that, having removed from there, she could be considered more likely to leave him
behind than those going to him; and in general she believed

Ann and Henrietta, being the first of the party,
the next morning we agreed to walk to the sea before breakfast.They are
went to the sand to watch the tide flow, which is fine
a southeast wind blew with all the greatness that
flat shore allowed.They praised the morning; famous at sea;
sympathized with the enjoyment of the fresh breeze - and were
quiet; until Henrietta suddenly starts again with ...

“Oh yes,” I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions,
sea ​​air always benefits.There can be no doubt that it was
greatest favor to Dr. Shirley since his illness last spring
twelve months.He declares that coming to Lyme for a month,
did him more good than all the drugs he took; and that being
the sea, always makes him feel young again.Now I can't help but think about it
it is a pity that he does not quite live by the sea.I really think he had
Better to leave Uppercross entirely and stay in Lyme..Isn't it, Ann?
You disagree with me that this is the best he could do, both
for yourself and Mrs. Shirley? She has cousins ​​here, and many
an acquaintance that would make her cheerful, and I'm sure she
would be glad to get to a place where she could receive medical assistance
close at hand in case of seizure recurrence.Actually I think it is
rather sad to have such wonderful people as Dr. and Mrs. Shirley,
who have done good all their lives, exhausting their last days
in a place like Uppercross where, with the exception of our family, they seem to be closed
from all over the world.I would like his friends to offer him this.I
really think they should.As for obtaining permission, there
there could be no difficulties in his time of life, and with his character.My
only doubt that anything could convince him to leave his parish.He is very strict and scrupulous in his views; overly scrupulous
must say.Ann, don't you think this is too delicate? Not
you think it's a delusion when a priest
sacrifices his health for the sake of responsibilities, which can also be
performed by another person? And in Lyme, too, only seventeen miles
away, he would be close enough to hear if people thought that
what to complain about."

Anna smiled to herself several times during this performance and entered
into an object, as ready to do good, entering into feelings

anything that was reasonable and suitable for the business; felt the claims

have always heard of Lady Russell as the woman of greatest influence
with everyone! I always find her able to convince a person
something! I am afraid of her, as I told you before, very afraid
about her because she is very smart; but I respect her tremendously, and
Wish we had such a neighbor in Uppercross."

Anne was amused by Henrietta's expression of gratitude and amused.

them.They came for a walk too, until breakfast was probably not
ready; but Louise immediately afterwards remembered that

in town.They were all at her disposal.When they reached the steps leading up from the beach,

back and stopped to make way for them.They got up and walked past him; as well as

like themselves, and determined that a handsome groom who

the first thing they heard since they drove into Lyme) drew half of the group to
window.It was a gentleman's carriage, a carriage, but only
all around from the stable yard to the front door; someone has to go
long away.He was led by a servant in mourning.The word "course" made Charles Musgrove jump up so he could compare

"Yes sir, Mr. Elliot, a gentleman of great fortune, entered last
night from Sidmouth.I dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you
were at dinner; and now we go to Kruckhern, on the road to Bath and

"No ma'am, he did not mention any particular family; but he said that

"Here! You see!" Mary exclaimed in ecstasy, "as I said!

"Putting all these very unusual circumstances together," said
Captain Wentworth, "we must view this as a disposition

When she was able to get Mary's attention, Anne quietly tried to convince
her that their father and Mr.

undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of common sense.She won't,
in any case, mention that she met him for the second time;

their previous outing, but she would feel rather ill-used by Ann

Little cousin interview must be kept secret.“Of course,” said Mary, “you will mention that we met with Mr. Elliot,
next time you write to Bath.I think my father should definitely hear
from this; mention everything about him."

Ann evaded a direct answer, but this was precisely the circumstance that she
is viewed not just as unnecessary information, but as something that
must be suppressed.An insult to her father
many years ago she knew; Elizabeth's special share in this is she
suspected; and that Mr Elliot's idea always irritated both
without any doubt.Mary herself never wrote to Bat; all work
maintaining a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth, fell
on Ann.Breakfast was soon over when the captain joined them and
Mrs. Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they appointed to take
their last walk in Lyme.They must go to
Uppercross one at a time, and in the meantime they should have been all together,
outside while they could.Ann discovered that Captain Benwick was approaching her as soon as they all
pretty outside.Their conversation the night before was not
to deprive him of his inclination to seek her again; and they walked together for a while,
still talking about Mr Scott and Lord Byron, and still unable to

changed in their party, and instead of Captain Benwick, she received
Captain Harville by her side.“Miss Elliot,” he said quietly, “you have done a good deed.
is to make this poor fellow talk so much.I wish he had this
company more often.I know that it is bad for him to be shut up the way he is;
But what can we do? We cannot part."

“No,” said Ann, “that I can easily believe in impossibility; but in
time, maybe - we know what time does in every disaster, and
you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend may still be called
young mourner - only last summer, as I understand it."

“Yes, really” (with a deep sigh) “Only June.."

"And unknown to him, probably so soon."

"Only in the first week of August, when he returned home from the cape,
just turned into a Grappler.I was in Plymouth afraid to hear about
his; he sent letters, but Grappler received an order
Portsmouth.There the news should follow him, but who was to say it?
not me.I would immediately run to the yard.No one could
do it, but this fellow "(pointing to Captain Wentworth.) "
Laconia had arrived in Plymouth the week before; there is no danger of her being
sent to sea again.He missed his chance for everything else; wrote for
vacation, but without waiting for the return, drove through the night and
days, until he reached Portsmouth, at the same moment swam to the Grappler,
and never left the poor fellow for a week.This is what he did, and
no one else could save poor James.You might think, Miss Elliot,
is he dear to us! "

Ann really thought about the question, making the perfect decision, and said so.
in response, how her own feeling could fulfill, or how it seemed capable of
bear because he was too excited to resume the topic, and when he
spoke again, it was about something completely different.Mrs Harville believes that her husband

themselves.By their reckoning, it was just the time;
but when they got to Cobb everyone wanted to take a walk
once again everyone was so inclined, and Louise soon became like that.
Determined that a quarter hour difference was found,
there will be no difference; so with all the goodbyes, and
any kind of exchange of invitations and promises that may be
imagined they parted with the captain and Mrs Harville at their door,
and still accompanied by Captain Benwick, who seemed to cling to them
until the last, proceeded to a proper farewell to Cobb.Ann found Captain Benwick approaching her again.."Dark" Lord Byron

and they agreed to go down the steps below, and
everyone was happy that they quietly and carefully descended the steep slope,

the feeling was amazing for her.The hardness of the asphalt for her

conviction, also lost her mind and would fall on the steps,
but for Captain Benwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between
them."Is there really no one for me to help?" were the first words that escaped
Captain Wentworth in a tone of despair and seemingly struggling

against the wall for his support, exclaimed in bitter agony:

"Oh God! Her father and mother!"

"Surgeon!" said Ann.He caught the word; he seemed to wake him up at once and said only:
“Right, right, now a surgeon,” she rushed away when Ann
willingly offered -

“Captain Benwick, isn't it better for Captain Benwick? He knows
where to find a surgeon."

Anyone capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea, and in

of the three who were completely rational suffered the most: the captain
Wentworth, Anne or Charles, really a very loving brother,
loomed over Louise, sobbing with grief, and could only look away from
one sister to see another in a state of numbness or to witness
the hysterical excitement of his wife, calling out to him for help, which he
could not give.Anna was present with all the strength and zeal, and thought that
instinct prompted Henrietta, who still tried, from time to time, to inspire
comfort others, tried to calm Mary, revive Charles,
soothe the senses of Captain Wentworth.Both seemed to be looking at her
for direction.“Ann, Ann,” Charles exclaimed, “what to do next?
the name of heaven, what to do next? "

Captain Wentworth's eyes were on her too..“Wouldn't it be better to take her to the hotel? Yes, I'm sure: take her
neatly to the hotel."

"Yes, yes, to the hotel," repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively
collected and want to do something."I will carry it myself.Musgrove, take care of others."

By this time, the message about the accident had spread among the workers.

straining, he said:

"We need to decide, and without wasting a minute.Everyone
minute is valuable.Someone has to make the decision to go to Uppercross
immediately.Musgrove, either you or I have to go."

Charles agreed, but announced his decision not to leave..It
will burden the captain and Mrs. Harville as little as possible;
but as for leaving his sister in this state, he should not and should not

same.However, she was soon persuaded to think otherwise..IN

worse than helpless! She was forced to admit that she could

was opened.“Then it is decided, Musgrove,” exclaimed Captain Wentworth, “that you
Stay and that I will take care of your sister's house.For the rest, like
the rest, if anyone stays behind to help Mrs Harville, I think it should be
only.Mrs. Charles Musgrove would certainly want to return to
her kids; but if Ann stays, there is no one more worthy, capable of
Ann."

She paused to recover from her emotions, hearing herself like this
talk about.The other two strongly agreed with what he said, and then she
emerged."You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her"; he exclaimed,
turning to her and speaking with fervor but tenderness,
seemed to almost restore the past.She painted a lot, and he
remembered myself and walked away.She expressed herself the most
I wish, ready, happy to stay."It was what she was thinking
and wanting to be able to do.Louise's bed on the floor

One more thing and everything seemed to be arranged.Although it was rather

send the carriage and horses home early in the morning, when
it would be a further advantage to send the report of the night to Louise.Captain Wentworth hastened to prepare everything from his side,
and soon two ladies will follow.When the plan was made
famous Mary, however, this was the end of the whole world.She was
so unhappy and so furious, complained so much about injustice
expected to leave instead of Ann; Anne, who meant nothing to Louise,
as long as she was her sister and had every right to stay at Henrietta's house.
instead of this! Why couldn't she be as helpful as Ann? And go home
without Charles, without her husband! No it was too unkind.As well as
in short, she said more than her husband could stand for long, and how
none of the others could resist, when he gave in, there was no help for
It; Mary's change to Anna was inevitable.Ann never submitted to the jealous and
Mary's unfounded claims; but it must be so and they went to
town, Charles looks after his sister, and Captain Benwick looks after
to her.She remembered for a moment when they hurried to
small circumstances witnessed by the same spots earlier in
morning.There she heard Henrietta's plans for a doctor.
Shirley leaves Uppercross; then she saw Mr. Elliot for the first time;
the moment seemed to everyone that now could be given to anyone other than Louise, or
those who were consumed by her well-being.Captain Benwick was very attentive to her; and combining as
they all seemed to be the disasters of the day, she felt the increasing
the degree of goodwill towards him, and the pleasure even from the thought that
this may be a reason to continue their acquaintance.Behind them were Captain Wentworth, and a phaeton with four seats.

Street; but his obvious surprise and annoyance at the substitution

surprise, expressions on their faces began and were suppressed, with which Charles
he was listened to, but Anne was given a humiliating reception; or should in
at least to convince her that she is appreciated only because she can be useful for
Louise.She tried to be calm and fair..No imitation
Emma's feelings for her Henry, she would take part in
Louise with a zeal above the usual demands of respect for his sake; as well as
she hoped that he would not be so unjust long as to suppose that she would shrink
unnecessarily from a friend's office.Meanwhile she was in the carriage.He turned them both in,
and stood between them; and so underneath that
circumstances full of amazement and excitement for Anna, she gave up
Lime.How long the stage will take; how did it affect them
manners; what would be their intercourse, she could not
foresee.However, all this was quite natural..He was betrayed
Henrietta; always turns to her; and when he spoke at all, always
in order to support her hopes and cheer her up.IN
general, his voice and manner were diligently calm.To spare Henrietta
excitement seemed like a guiding principle.Only once when she
mourned the last unjust, ill-fated trip to Cobb,
mourning bitterly that they had ever thought of it, he exploded like
if completely overcome -

“Don't talk about it, don't talk about it,” he shouted.."Oh God! What did I have
did not give way to her at the fateful moment! If I did as I should! But
so impatient and so determined! Dear, sweet Louise! "

Ann wondered if it had crossed his mind now to question
the validity of his own previous opinion of universal happiness and
the advantage of fortitude; and can it hit him
that, like all other qualities of the mind, it must have
proportions and limits.She thought that he was unlikely to elude
feel that the bias towards persuasion can sometimes be just as beneficial
happiness as a very determined character.They quickly entered.Anne was surprised to recognize the same hills and
the same objects so soon.Their real speed, amplified by some fear
conclusion, made the road appear, but twice as short as a day
before.However, it was already getting dark before they were in
the neighborhood of Uppercross, and there was complete silence.

on her face, giving hope that she cried before going to bed;
as they climbed their last hill, Ann found that

said: -

Mr and Mrs Musgrove.Do you think this is a good plan? "

conversion remained a pleasure for her as a proof of friendship and

saw that father and mother were as balanced as one could hope, and
his daughter is all the better that with them, he announced his intention

Chapter 13


The rest of Anne's time in Uppercross, comprehending only two
days was completely spent in the mansion; and she had
the satisfaction of knowing that she is extremely useful here, as
direct companion, and as an aid in all these activities for
a future which, in the depressed state of mind of Mr and Mrs Musgrove,
there would be difficulties.The next morning they had an early bill from Lyme..Louise was very

persuaded to go early to their inn last night.Mary was
hysteria again this morning.When he left, she was going
go out with Captain Benwick, which he hoped would do her good.It
almost regretted being persuaded to return home the day before;
but the truth was that Mrs. Harville left nothing to anyone."

Charles was supposed to return to Lyme on the same day, and his father

both houses, of everything that gave Uppercross its cheerful character.A few days really made a difference!

If Louise recovers, everything will be all right again.More than the former
happiness will be restored.In her opinion, there could be no doubt
there was nothing that followed her recovery.After a few months
and the room is now so deserted, occupied only by her silent, pensive me,
can be filled again with everything that was happy and cheerful, with everything that was
shining and bright in a prosperous love, all this was most unlike Ann

should visit her soon.Ann, have the courage to come with me and pay

changed hands better than its owners.These beliefs should
undoubtedly have their own pain, and its kind was strong; but they
eliminated the pain that Lady Russell would have experienced by entering
home again, and returning through famous apartments.At such moments, Anna could not say to herself: “These rooms
should only belong to us.Oh, how they fell in their destiny! how
unworthily busy! An ancient family so exiled!
Strangers fill their place! »No, except when she thought about her
mother, and remembering where she had previously sat and presided over, she
didn't sigh at this description to flinch.Mrs Croft always greeted her with a kindness that pleased her.

The admiral finished quickly, exclaiming:

Anne, involuntarily amused, was very upset because of the answer:
and the admiral, fearing that he might not have been polite enough, took
again a subject to say ...

"Next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot, please give
to him my compliments and Mrs. Croft, and to say that we settled here

as soon as possible after returning to Uppercross, they drove to

although pure, she was extremely weak, and her nerves are susceptible to
the highest extreme of tenderness; and although it could be declared
overall, things are going very well, it was still impossible to tell when she
may be able to reschedule the move home; and her father and mother who
must be back in time to receive their youngest children for Christmas
holidays, hardly hoped that she would be allowed to take her with her.They were all together in the apartment.Mrs Musgrove got Mrs
Harville's children, as long as possible, all kinds of supplies.

staying so long she found more pleasure than misery.Charles
Hayter was in Lyme more often than she wanted; and when they had dinner
only a maid was waiting at the Garvills, and
first, Mrs. Harville has always preferred Mrs. Musgrove; but then,
she received such a lovely apology from her when she found out
whose daughter she was, and so many things happened every day,
there were so many walks between their apartment and Garville,
and she took books from the library and changed them so often that
the balance was definitely in Lyme's favor.She was
taken to Charmouth too, and she washed up, and she went to church,
and there were many more people in the church to look at.
Lime than Uppercross; and all this, along with the feeling of being like this
very useful, earned a really enjoyable two weeks.Ann asked about Captain Benwick..Mary's face was darkened straight.Charles laughed."Oh! Captain Benwick, I think he is very healthy, but he is very strange
young man.I do not know what he will be in.We asked him to come
home with us for a day or two: Charles pledged to give him some

everything was decided; when here! on tuesday night he is very awkward

and he promised this, and he promised this, and the end of this
I found that he was not going to come.I suppose he was afraid
finding it boring; but honestly i should have thought we were alive
enough for a man as heartbroken as Captain Benwick in the cottage.."

Charles laughed again and said, “Mary, you know very well how
really was.It's all your business "(referring to Ann.) "He liked this
that if he goes with us, he will find you nearby: he imagined
everyone should live in Uppercross; and when he found that lady
Russell lived three miles from him, his heart broke down, and he did not

But Mary did not give in too kindly, or because
Considering that Captain Benwick has the right by birth and position to be in
love with Elliot, or because of unwillingness to believe Anna for more
attraction to Uppercross than herself must be abandoned to guess.However, Anna's benevolence was not diminished by what she heard..She boldly admitted that she was flattered and continued her questioning.."Oh, he's talking about you," Charles exclaimed, "with these words ..." Mary
interrupted him."I declare, Charles, I have never heard him mention Ann
twice the whole time i was there.I declare Ann he never talks about you
at all."

“No,” admitted Charles, “I don’t know what he ever did, in general
way; but nevertheless, it is quite obvious that he admires you
extremely.His head is full of books that he reads.

found something in one of them that he thinks - oh! I
I can’t pretend I remember it, but it was something very good - I

was said to the highest degree! Now Mary, I declare that it was so, I
I heard it myself, but you were in another room.'Elegance, sweetness,
beauty.'Oops! there was no end to Miss Elliot's charm."

“And I’m sure,” Mary exclaimed warmly, “it was very little for him
credit if he did.Miss Harville only died last June.Such a heart
very little worth having; is it Lady Russell? I am sure that you will
agree with me."

"I must see Captain Benwick before I can make a decision," Lady Russell said.

said Charles."Although he did not have the courage to leave with us, and
after that, having gone here again on an official visit, he will make
one day he will get to Kellinch himself, you can count on it.I
told him the distance and the way, and I told him about the church
to be so noteworthy; because he loves such
things, I thought it would be a good reason, and he listened
all his understanding and soul; and I am sure from his manners that you
he will call here soon.So I notify you Lady Russell."

“Any acquaintance of Anna will always be desirable for me,” said the lady.
Russell's kind answer."ABOUT! As for being Anna's acquaintance, said Mary, I think he's pretty
my friend, because I saw him every day for the last
two weeks."

"Well, as your mutual acquaintance, I will be very glad to see
Captain Benwick."

"You will not find anything pleasant in him, I assure you, ma'am..He is one of the saddest young people who ever lived..He walked with
me, sometimes, from one end of the sand to the other, without speaking
word.He is not a well-mannered young man..I'm sure you won't
like he."

“This is where we parted, Mary,” Ann said.."I think Lady Russell would like
his.I think she would be so pleased with his mind that she
very soon will not see any flaws in his manner."

“Me too, Ann,” Charles said.."I'm sure Lady Russell will like.He's just like Lady Russell.Give him a book and he will read everything
all day."

"Yes, that he will!" exclaimed Mary, mockingly."He will sit looking
over his book, and I don't know when a person is talking to him, or when someone
drops scissors or anything that happens.Do you think lady
Russell would like that? "

Lady Russell couldn't help laughing..“Honestly,” she said, “I

"You won't like him, I will answer for it.."

Lady Russell spoke of something else.Mary spoke to

than their number.When, shortly thereafter, Lady Russell was

was very indignant.The one who ever bragged that he was Elliot, and
whose feelings about connection were too strict to satisfy

Chapter 16


There was one moment that Ann, after returning to the family,
was more grateful for finding out even what Mr. Elliot is in love with
with Elizabeth, that is, her father was not in love with Mrs
Clay; and it was very difficult for her when she was in
home a few hours.The next morning, when going to breakfast, she
discovered that on the part of the lady there was only a decent pretense
meaning to leave them.She could imagine Mrs Clay said that
"Now Miss Anne has come, she could not imagine that she was needed at all";
Elizabeth replied in a whisper, “It shouldn't be
reason really.I assure you I don't feel it.She's nothing to me
compared to you; "and she was fully to hear her father say,
"My dear madam, this should not be.Until you saw nothing

from us now.You must stay to meet Mrs. Wallis,

He spoke and looked so seriously that Anne was not surprised

a compromise of decency on the side of the Elliots."

Sir Walter, however, chose his own means and finally wrote

admire the letter; but he did everything he wanted, brought three

While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were hard at work

other description.She called her former governess and learned from her that

her separation from home and the suffering of a fourteen year old girl

and Miss Hamilton, three years older than her, but still of
the absence of close relatives and a settled home, the remaining year in
school, was useful and kind to her, which is much
reduced her suffering, and could never recall with indifference.Miss Hamilton dropped out of school, soon got married, was
say that she married a lucky man, and that was all that Anna had
known about her, to this day, when the account of their governess brought her
the situation forward in a more decisive but completely different form.She was a widow and poor.Her husband was extravagant; and in his
death, about two years ago, terribly left his affairs
involved.She had to deal with all sorts of difficulties, and
in addition to this suffering, he suffered from serious
rheumatic fever that finally came down to her feet made her
real cripple.For this reason, she came to Bath and was
now in an apartment near hot baths, I live very modestly, unable to
even afford the comfort of a servant, and, of course, almost
excluded from society.Their mutual friend responded for the satisfaction of the visit.
Miss Elliot will give Mrs. Smith, and so Ann, wasting no time,
going.She did not mention anything from what she heard or what she
intended, at home.It would not arouse proper interest there..Only she
consulted Lady Russell, who was completely immersed in her feelings, and
was very happy to show her how close to Mrs Smith's apartment
Westgate buildings, as Ann chose..The visit was made, their acquaintance was restored, their interest
in each other more than revived.The first ten minutes were
awkwardness and her emotions.Twelve years have passed since they
parted, and each imagined himself to be somewhat different from what
the other represented.Twelve years have changed Anna from blooming,
a silent, shapeless girl of fifteen, an elegant little woman
twenty-seven years, all beauty except flowering, and manners, like
deliberately right, because they were invariably gentle; and twelve years old had
transformed the beautiful, well-grown Miss Hamilton in all her radiance
health and confidence in superiority, in the poor, weak, helpless

what was uncomfortable at the meeting soon passed and left
only an interesting charm of memories of past addictions and
talk about old times.Anne found in Mrs. Smith common sense and pleasant manners, which she liked.

cheerful beyond her expectations.Nor dissipation
of the past - and she lived a lot in this world - no restrictions
the present, neither illness nor sorrow seemed to cover her
heart or ruined her mood.On the second visit, she spoke very openly, and
Anna's surprise increased.She could hardly imagine more
the situation itself is more bleak than Mrs. Smith's..She loved very much
her husband: she buried him.She's used to abundance:
It's gone.She didn't have a child to connect with life and happiness
again, there are no relatives to help in solving complicated cases,
no health so that everything else can be maintained.Her accommodation was
confined to a noisy living room and a dark bedroom behind, without
the ability to move from one to another without assistance, which
there was only one servant in the house, and she never
left the house, but must be transferred to a warm bath.However, despite
from all this, Anna had reason to believe that she had only moments
lethargy and depression, by hours of study and pleasure.how
could it be? She looked, watched, contemplated and finally decided
that it was not only a manifestation of fortitude or humility.BUT
a submissive spirit could be patient, a strong understanding could give
permission, but there was more to it; this elasticity
mind, this penchant for comfort, this ability to turn easily
from evil to good and find a job that would force her
herself, who was by nature alone.It was the best gift

thanks to the gracious designation, it seems that it is intended to counterbalance the almost

ownership of her apartment before she was bedridden again and
suffers from severe and persistent pain; and all this among strangers,
with the absolute need to have a full-time nurse and finances in
this point is especially inappropriate to cover any extraordinary expenses.She is
experienced it, however, and could actually say that it made her
OK.It increased her comfort, making her feel
in safe hands.She has seen too much of the world to expect a sudden or
disinterested affection wherever, but illness showed her
that her landlord must maintain her character and will not use her
sick; and she was especially lucky with a nanny, like a sister

this house, when it was unemployed, happened to be free just in time to
come to her.“And she,” said Mrs. Smith, “besides the one that fed me the most.

could use my hands, she taught me to knit, which was great
entertainment; and she stopped me from making these little

but when Nurse Rook has half an hour of free time to share with me, she
be sure to have something to tell entertaining and profitable:
something that allows you to better know your look.Like to hear
what happens to keep up with the newest ways of being
trifling and stupid.For me living so much alone, her conversation, I
I assure you it's a pleasure."

Ann, not wanting to find fault with pleasure, replied: "I can easily
believe it.Women of this class have great opportunities, and if they
smart, maybe worth listening to.Such varieties
human nature, as they used to testify! And it is not so
simply in their stupidity that they are well-read; because they see it
sometimes under any circumstances that may be most interesting or
influencing.What examples should appear before them ardent,
disinterested, selfless affection, heroism, fortitude,
patience, humility: all conflicts and all victims
what ennobles us the most.The sick room can often bring
volumes."

“Yes,” said Mrs. Smith with great doubt, “sometimes it can be, although I’m afraid
his lessons are not often in the sublime style you describe.That's
there human nature can be great in times of trial; but in general
speaking, it is his weakness, and not his strength, that manifests itself in
patient's room: this is more selfishness and impatience than generosity
and the fortitude that everyone hears about.So little real friendship
in the world! and, unfortunately, "(quietly and quiveringly)" there
so many who forget to think seriously until it's almost too late."

Anna saw the grief of such feelings.The husband was not who he was
had to, and the wife was carried among that part of humanity that did
she thinks of the world worse than she deserves.It was just
fleeting emotions, however, with Mrs Smith; she shook it off and soon
added in a different tone -

"I don't think my friend Mrs. Rook is in the current situation,
will provide a lot to interest or teach me.She only feeds
Mrs Wallis of the Marlborough Buildings; just beautiful, stupid, dear,
a fashionable woman, I suppose; and of course there will be nothing to report
but made of lace and ornaments.I want to profit from Mrs. Wallis
However.She has a lot of money and I intend that she will buy everything
expensive things are in my hands now."

Ann visited her friend several times before
such a man was famous in Camden Place.Finally the need arose
talk about her.Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs. Clay returned one
morning from Laura Place, with an unexpected invitation from Lady Dalrymple
that evening, and Ann was already engaged to spend this
evening in Westgate buildings.She didn't apologize.They are
only asked if she was sure because Lady Dalrymple was being held in
home because of a bad cold, was happy to use the relationship that
there was such pressure on her; and she refused of her own accord with great
liveliness - "She was engaged to spend an evening with an old
classmate."They were not particularly interested in anything related to
Ann; but still enough questions were asked to
realized what kind of old school friend he was; and Elizabeth was
contemptuous and sir Walter stern."Westgate Buildings!" he said, "and who is Miss Ann Elliot to be
visiting Westgate Buildings? Mrs Smith.Mrs. Smith's widow; as well as
who was her husband? One of the five thousand Mr. Smith whose names
meet everywhere.And what is its appeal? That she is old
and painful.Honestly Miss Anne Elliot, you have the most
extraordinary taste! Anything that resent others is low
company, pitiful rooms, bad air, disgusting associations beckon
you.But you can, of course, put off this old woman until tomorrow: she
I suppose she is not so close to her end, but she may hope to see another
day.How old is she? Forty?"

"No sir, she's not thirty-one; but I don't think I can put off
my engagement because this is the only evening in a while
immediately suits her and me.Tomorrow she goes to a warm bath
and by the end of the week we're engaged."

"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?" asked
Elizabeth.“She does not see anything to blame in this,” replied Anna; "on the contrary, she
approves of this and usually accepts me when I visit Mrs.
Smith."

"Westgate Buildings must have been quite surprised by the appearance

Henry Russell's widow really has no honor to distinguish her hands.

Ireland! Mrs Smith! Such a name! "

Mrs. Clay, who had been present while this was going on, now thought that
it is advisable to leave the room, and Ann could say a lot and did
I want to say a little in defense of not very unlike a friend

even Lady Russell in discussing her merits; and Ann couldn't be
given to understand so much by her friend, she could not know that she
so highly regarded by a sane person, without many pleasant
the sensations her friend wanted to create.Lady Russell was now quite determined in her opinion of Mr. Elliot..She was as convinced that he wanted Anne on time, as well as that he

give him the freedom to manifest his most open abilities to give pleasure.She is

Anna had to turn away, get up, walk to the far table,
and, relying on imaginary employment, try to suppress feelings

were bewitched.The idea of ​​becoming who her mother was; of
the precious name "Lady Elliot" was reborn for the first time in herself; of

It was early February; and Ann, having spent a month in
Bath was eagerly awaiting news from Uppercross and Lyme..She is
wanted to hear much more than Mary said.There were three
weeks since she even heard.She only knew that Henrietta was in
home again; and that Louise, though believed to be recovering rapidly,
was still in Lyme; and she thought of everyone very intently alone
in the evening, when the letter from Mary was delivered more dense than usual.
her; and, to increase the pleasure and surprise, with the admiral and Mrs
Croft compliments.Croft should be in Bath! Circumstance to interest her.They were
people to whom her heart turned very naturally."What is it?" exclaimed Sir Walter."Have the Croft arrived in Bath?
Croft renting Kellinch? What did they bring you? "

"Letter from Uppercross Cottage, sir."

"Ah, these letters are convenient passports.They provide
introduction.However, I had to visit Admiral Croft at any
indicator.I know what has to do with my tenant."

Ann could no longer listen; she couldn't even tell how poor

rather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the group because he
was invited in the same way as Garville; and what do you think was

did not dare to go to Uppercross until he received an answer from Mr.
Musgrove; because everything was decided between him and her before she came
away and he wrote to her father Captain Harville.True, on
my honor! Are you not surprised? I will be surprised at least if

Mary did not need to fear that her sister was in any way prepared for
news.Never in her life was she so surprised.Captain

know if the Croft rode with four horses and
were located in a part of Bath that could accommodate Miss
Elliot and himself to visit; but there was little curiosity other than."How is Mary?" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer, "And
pray what brought the Croft to Bath? "

"They go to the admiral's account.He is believed to have gout."

"Gout and decrepitude!" said Sir Walter."Poor old gentleman."

"Do they have any acquaintances here?" asked Elizabeth."I do not know; but I can hardly imagine that in the days of Admiral Croft
life, and in his profession he should not have many acquaintances in
a place like this."

“I suspect,” Sir Walter said coldly, “that Admiral Croft will be the best
known in Bath as a tenant of Kellinch Hall.Elizabeth, can we
dare to introduce him and his wife to Laura Place? "

"Oh no! I think not.Situated like Lady Dalrymple and I, cousins,
we must be very careful not to embarrass her with the acquaintance she
may not approve.If we weren't relatives, it wouldn't matter; but
as cousins, she would be scrupulous about any of our suggestions.we

This was part of Sir Walter and Elizabeth's interest in writing;
when Mrs.Clay paid her due closer attention, in

and Lord Byron; no, this has probably already been studied; of course they
fell in love with poetry.Louise Musgrove's idea turned upside down
into a man of literary taste, and sentimental reflections were
funny, but she had no doubt that it was.A day in Lyme
falling off Cobb can affect her health, her nerves, her
courage, her character for the rest of her life, as carefully as this
seemed to influence her fate.In general, it was concluded that if a woman who was
wise in the merits of Captain Wentworth could be allowed to prefer
another man, there was nothing in the engagement to worry about
be surprised; and if Captain Wentworth did not lose a friend because of this, of course
nothing to regret.No, it was not regret that made Anna's heart
fought in spite of herself, and her cheeks turned red when
she thought of Captain Wentworth, freed from his shackles and free.She had little
feelings she was ashamed to explore.They were too similar

She really wanted to see the Croft; but when the meeting took place, it was

When they moved a little further, Ann decided to press again
what he had to report.She hoped that when she got out of Millsom Street,
satisfy her curiosity; but she still had to wait because
the admiral decided not to start until they received
the greater space and silence of Belmont; and since she was not really Mrs.
Croft, she should let him go his own way.Once they were fair
climbing Belmont, he began:

"Well, now you will hear something that will surprise you.But first
in general, you must tell me the name of the young lady with whom I am going to talk
about.This young lady, you know we were all so worried
for.Miss Musgrove, to whom all this happened..Her
Christian name: I always forget her Christian name."

Anna was ashamed to seem that she understood as soon as she
done; but now she could boldly suggest the name "Louise."

"Yes, Miss Louise Musgrove, that's the name.I wish the young ladies
there weren't so many beautiful Christian names.I should never go out
if they were all Sophis, or something like that.Well this miss

Benwick.You know James Benwick."

"Small.I am a little familiar with Captain Benwick."

"Well, she will marry him.No, most likely they are already married,
because I don't know what to expect."

“I thought Captain Benwick was a very nice young man,” Anne said, “and
I understand that he has a great character."

"Oh, yes, yes, you can't say a word against James Benwick..He's just a commander, however, he did it last summer, which is bad
times to continue, but it has no other error that I am aware of.An
a great, kind-hearted guy, I assure you; very active, diligent
officer too, which is more than you think maybe for this
gentle manners don't do him justice."

"Indeed, you are wrong, sir; I must never foresee the lack of
spirit from the manner of captain Benwick.I thought about them especially
nice, and I will answer for it, they would have liked at all."

"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick would rather
too piano for me; and although it is very likely that this is all our addiction,
Sophie and I can't help but think that Frederick's manners are better than his..There is something more to our taste about Frederick."

Ann caught.She only wanted to confront an all too common idea
spirit and gentleness are incompatible with each other, not at all
to present Captain Benwick's manners as the best that could
it is possible to be; and after a little hesitation she began to speak:
“I wasn’t going to compare two friends,” but
The admiral interrupted her:

yesterday in which he tells us about it and he just got it in

"Not at all, there is no oath, no murmur from the side

While Admiral Croft walked with Ann and expressed his

already on the way there.Before Mrs. Croft wrote, he was

On appeal, Elliot decided that his cousin Anna's boots were
the fattest.Accordingly, it was decided that Mrs. Clay should be in the party in

she was the greatest prostitute in the world, the most inexplicable and
absurd! For several minutes she saw nothing in front of her; that was all
confusion.She got lost and when she lived up to her feelings, she
found that the others were still waiting for the carriage, and Mr Elliot (always
helpfully) just went to Union Street on behalf of Mrs.
Clay's.Now she felt a strong urge to go to the outer door; she wanted

that she betrayed the slightest sensitivity of the two.She had
his advantage in preparing the last few moments.Everything

were with her.But still it was enough for her to feel! It was
excitement, pain, pleasure, something between delight and suffering.He spoke to her and then turned away.The nature of his manner was
embarrassment.She couldn't call it cold or friendly

watching them, he turned to Anna again and in manners rather than words,
offered her his services.“I owe you a lot,” she replied, “but I'm not going to
them.The crew did not fit as much.I walk: I prefer
walking."

"But it's raining."

"Oh! Very little, nothing that I believe."

After a moment's pause, he said: “Although I only came yesterday, I have

umbrella); "I would like you to use it if you are determined

She was very much obliged to him, but she refused, repeating her
the conviction that rain will get nowhere now, and adding:
"I'm just waiting for Mr. Elliot.He'll be here in a moment, I
Sure."

She had scarcely said these words when Mr. Elliot entered..Captain
Wentworth remembered him well.There was no difference between
he and the man who stood on the steps in Lyme, admiring Ann as
she passed except for the air, the look and the manner of the privileged
relative and friend.He entered with impatience, seemed to see and
thought only of her, apologized for his stay, was saddened that he kept
she is waiting, and really wants to take her away without wasting time
and before the rain increased; and in another moment they left
together, her hand under his hand, a tender and embarrassed look, and
"Good morning!" be everything she had time for when she was going through
long away.Once they were out of sight, Captain Wentworth's ladies
the party started talking about them."I suppose Mr. Elliot has no dislike for his cousin?"

"Oh no, that's clear enough.You can guess what will be there.He is always with them; half-life in the family, I believe.What the
very nice man! "

"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who once dined with him at Wallis, says
he is the nicest man she has ever been with."

"I think she's pretty; Anne Elliot; very pretty in terms of
look at her.It's not fashionable to say that, but I confess I admire
her more than her sister."

"Oh me too."

"I, too.No comparison.But men are all wild after miss
Elliot.Anne is too delicate for them."

Ann would be especially grateful to her cousin if he
walked beside her all the way to Camden Place without saying
word.Although she had never found it so difficult to listen to him.
nothing could surpass his care and concern, and although his subjects
were basically the kind that were always interesting: praise,
warm, just and insightful words about Lady Russell and innuendo
very rational against Mrs Clay.But now she could only think about
Captain Wentworth.She couldn't understand his real feelings
whether he really suffered from frustration or not; as well as
until that moment she could not be herself.She hoped to be wise and sensible in time; but alas! Alas! she must
admit to myself that she was not wise yet.Another circumstance that was very important for her to know was how long he
destined to be in Bath; he didn’t mention it or she couldn’t
remember this.He could only get through.But it was more
it is likely that he should stay.In such a case, the responsibility is like

All will be?

She had already been forced to tell Lady Russell that Louise Musgrove
was supposed to marry Captain Benwick.She should have collided with something
Lady Russell's surprise; and now if she was by chance
in company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge
this question may add another tinge of prejudice to it.The next morning, Anne went out with her friend, and for the first time
hour, in an incessant and terrible vigil for him in vain; but in
finally, returning down Palteny Street, she noticed him at
right sidewalk at such a distance that he can see
most of the street.There were many other men around him, many
the groups go the same, but it could not be confused.She is
instinctively looked at Lady Russell; but not from a crazy idea about her
recognizing him as quickly as herself.No it shouldn't have been
assumed Lady Russell would notice him until they had
opposite.From time to time, however, she looked at her with dismay; as well as
when the moment came that should point to him, although he did not dare
look again (she knew that her own face was unfit to be seen),
she was still well aware that Lady Russell's eyes were
exactly in that direction for him - in short, intently
watching him.She could fully understand the look of admiration
he must master Lady Russell's mind, it must be
look away, she must be amazed that
eight or nine years had to pass over him, and in foreign lands
and in active service, without depriving him of any personal grace!

Finally Lady Russell threw back her head."Now how could she talk about
his?"

“You will be surprised,” she said, “what has attracted my attention for so long; but
I looked after the curtains on the windows that Lady Alicia and Mrs
Frankland told me about last night.They described
window-curtains of the living room of one of the houses on this side
By the way, this part of the street, as the most beautiful and
in Bath, but I cannot remember the exact number, and I have
tried to figure out what it could be; but I confess I don't see
curtains that match their description."

Ann sighed, blushed, and smiled with pity and contempt, or she
friend or herself.Most of all, she was provoked by the fact that in everything
this waste of foresight and caution, she should have lost the right
moment to see if he saw them.A day or two went by without producing anything.Theater or
the rooms he is likely to be in were not fashionable enough for
Elliots, whose evening entertainment was exclusively in elegant
the stupidity of private parties, where there are more and more of them
infatuated; and Ann, tired of this state of stagnation, tired of
knowing nothing and imagining herself stronger, because her strength was
did not try, was very impatiently waiting for the concert evening.It was
a concert in favor of the man patronized by Lady Dalrymple.Of
course they must attend.It was expected to be good, and
Captain Wentworth was very fond of music.If she only had a few
minutes of talking to him again, it seemed to her that she should be
satisfied; and as for being able to reach out to him, she felt
courage if the opportunity presents itself.Elizabeth turned her back on him
Lady Russell did not notice him; her nerves were strengthened by these
circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.She once made a partial promise to Mrs Smith to spend an evening with her;
but in a short hasty call she excused herself and put it aside,
the more decisive promise of a longer visit tomorrow.Mrs Smith
gave a very good-natured consent."By all means," she said; "just tell me about it when you come.Who is your party? "

Ann named them all.Mrs Smith said nothing; but when she left
she said, and with a half-serious, half-serious expression on her face: "Well, I
I sincerely wish your concert to respond; and don't let me down tomorrow if
You can come; because I start having premonitions that I may not have much
more visits from you."

Ann was startled and bewildered; but standing in the blink of an eye

waiting, they took up their station at one of the bonfires in the Octagon.
room.But as soon as they settled down, the door opened again, and
Captain Wentworth entered alone.Ann was the closest to him, and
taking another small step forward, she immediately spoke.He cooked
just bow and walk on, but her gentle "How are you?" brought it
stand next to her and make inquiries in
return despite the formidable father and sister in the back
land.Their stay in the background was a support for Anna; she knew
nothing of their appearance, and felt equal to everything that she believed in
right to be done.As they spoke, her father and Elizabeth whispered to each other.
caught her in the ear.She couldn't discern, but she must guess
thing; and when Captain Wentworth gave a distant bow, she
realized that her father judged so well that he gave it to him
simple recognition of acquaintance, and she just had time
side glance to see a slight curtsy from Elizabeth herself.This,
although late, reluctant and unfriendly, it is still better than
nothing and her mood improved.After talking, however, about the weather, Bath and the concert,
their conversation began to subside, and at last so little was said that
she expected him to leave every second, but he did not; he seemed in
do not rush to leave her; and now with a renewed spirit, with a little
a smile, a little glow, he said ...

"I hardly saw you since our days in Lyme.I'm afraid you should

you at that time."

She assured him that she would not."It was a terrible hour," he said, "a terrible day!" and he passed
his hand closed his eyes, as if the memory was still too painful,
but after a moment, half-smiling again, he added:
effects however; had some consequences that should be seen as
the complete opposite of terrible.When you got your mind
assume that Benwick would be the most suitable person to call a surgeon,
You couldn't imagine that he would end up becoming one of the most
worried about her recovery."

"Of course I couldn't have anything.But it looks like - I hope it will
be a very happy match.There are good principles on both sides and
good temperament."

“Yes,” he said, not looking straight ahead; "but this, I think, ends
likeness.With all my heart I wish them happiness and rejoice
all circumstances in favor of this.They have no difficulties
fight at home, no objection, no whims, no delay.IN
Musgroves behave like themselves, very honest and friendly,
concerned only with sincere parental hearts to promote
comfort.All this is very, very conducive to their happiness;
more than possible ... "

He stopped.A sudden memory seemed to come to his mind, and
the taste of that emotion that blushed Anna's cheeks and corrected
her eyes to the ground.However, after clearing his throat, he
continued this way -

"I confess, I really think there is a discrepancy, too much discrepancy,
and in a point no less important than the mind.I believe Louise Musgrove
as a very kind, gentle girl and not lacking in
understanding, but Benwick is more.He's a smart man
reading person; and I confess that I believe he is attached to
her with some surprise.If it was the effect of gratitude, if it
learned to love her because he believed that she preferred him, this
it would be different.But I have no reason to assume so.On the contrary, it seems that it was completely spontaneous,
untrained feeling on his side and it surprises me.A man like him
in his situation! with a pierced heart, wounded, almost broken! Fanny
Harville was a very high level being, and his affection for her was
really affection.A man won't recover from such devotion
heart of such a woman.He shouldn't; he is not."

Either from the consciousness that his friend has recovered,
or from another consciousness he did not go further; and Ann, who despite
the agitated voice with which the last part was uttered, and in
despite all the sounds in the room, almost continuous clapping
doors and the incessant hum of people passing through
discerned every word, was amazed, delighted, confused and
begins to breathe very quickly and feel a hundred things in
moment.It was impossible for her to bring up such a topic; and still,
after a pause, feeling the need to speak, and not having
from the slightest desire to completely change, she deviated only enough to say:

- I think you had a good time in Lyme?

"About two weeks.I couldn't leave it until Louise was well.
well established.I was too deeply troubled by this evil to
be in the world soon.It was my business, exclusively mine.She won't
would be stubborn if I were not weak.Country around Lyme
very good.I walked and rode a lot; and the more I saw, the
more i found to admire."

“I would love to see Lyme again,” Ann said.."Indeed! I shouldn't have imagined that you could find anything
in Lyme to make that feeling.The horror and sorrow that you were in
involved in stretching the mind, exhausting the spirits! i should have
thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been intense disgust."

“The last hours were, of course, very painful,” Anne replied; "but when
the pain has passed, the memory of it often becomes a pleasure.One does
not to love the place, all the more because he suffered in it, unless it
all suffering, nothing but suffering, which in no way was in
Lime.We've only been in anxiety and dismay for the last two hours
and there was a lot of fun before.So much
novelty and beauty! I have traveled so little that every fresh place
it would be interesting for me; but there is real beauty in Lyme; And in
short "(slightly blushing with some recollections)", generally my
the impressions of the place are very pleasant."

When she was silent, the front door opened again, and the party itself
appeared who they were waiting for.Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple
there was a joyous sound; and with all the fervor compatible with
with unsettling elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet
her.Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, accompanied by Mr Elliot and
Colonel Wallis, who arrived at almost the same instant,
moved into the room.The others joined them, and it was a group of
which Ann also included.She was divided
by Captain Wentworth.Their interesting, almost too interesting
the conversation should be interrupted for a while, but the repentance was insignificant
compared to the happiness that brought him! She learned in
the last ten minutes, most of his feelings for Louise, most of all
his feelings, which she did not dare to think about; and she gave herself up
the party's demands for politeness at the moment, with
exquisite yet aroused sensations.She was in a good mood since
everything.She received ideas that incline her towards politeness and politeness.
kind to everyone and pity everyone, because she is less happy than herself.Delightful emotions were a little muted when, stepping back,
from the group that Captain Wentworth was to join again, she saw that
he left.She just had time to see how it turned into a concert.
room.He left; he disappeared, she regretted for a moment.But "they must meet again.He will look for her, he will find her
before the evening ended, but now maybe it was like this
good to be divided.She needed a little break for
memory."

Shortly after Lady Russell appeared, the whole party was
collected, and all that's left is to collect yourself and continue
to the concert hall; and have all the consequences in their power,
draw as many eyes as possible, stir up as many whispers as possible and disturb as many people as possible
how could they.Elizabeth and Anne Elliot were very, very happy when they entered..Elizabeth hand in hand with Miss Carteret, looking at the broad back
Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple had nothing to wish for
for which it did not seem within her reach; and Ann - but it would be
an insult to the nature of Anna's happiness in order to draw any comparison between

all generous affections.Ann saw nothing, thought nothing of the magnificence of the room..Her
happiness was from the inside.Her eyes were shining, her cheeks were shining;
but she didn't know anything about it.She only thought about the last half
hour, and as they approached their seats, her thoughts quickly set a course for

the inferiority opinion of Louise Musgrove, the opinion he had

as for the first strong attachment; started sentences that he could not
finish, his half-averted eyes and more than half-expressive gaze,
everyone, everyone said that at least he had a heart coming back to her; what
there was no more anger, resentment, avoidance; and what they were
succeeded not only with friendship and attention, but also with tenderness
of the past.Yes, some of the tenderness of the past.She could
do not view changes as implying less.He must love her.These were thoughts with accompanying visions that occupied and occupied
excited her too much to leave her with any observation; and she
walked around the room without seeing him, not even
trying to see it.When their places were determined and they
everything was arranged properly, she looked around to see if it should happen
be in the same part of the room, but he was not; her eyes could not
get it out; and the concert is just beginning, she must agree to
time to be more humble.The group was split up and placed on two adjacent benches: Ann
was among the first, and Mr. Elliot was so good at maneuvering,
with the help of his friend Colonel Wallis to take a seat with
her.Miss Elliot flanked by cousins ​​and main subject
the gallantry of Colonel Wallis, was quite pleased.Ann's mind was in the most favorable state for amusement
evening; that was enough: she had feelings for
tenderness, perfume for gays, attention to scientists and patience
for the tedious; and never liked a concert better, at least
during the first act.Closer to its end, in the intermission
after the Italian song, she explained the words of the song to Mr.
Elliot.There was a concert score in between.“This,” she said, “is almost a meaning, or rather a meaning

"Yes, yes, I see that you.I see you don't understand anything in this matter.You
knowledge of the language is enough to immediately translate these
inverted, transposed, shortened Italian lines into crisp,
clear, elegant English.You don't need to say anything more about
your ignorance.Here's the complete proof."

"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I would be sorry to be
tested by a real professional."

"I haven't had the pleasure of being in Camden Place for so long,"
he replied, "knowing nothing of Miss Anne Elliot; and I
consider her too humble for the world as a whole
aware of half of her accomplishments, and too educated to
humility to be natural in any other woman."

"A shame! A shame! This is too much flattery..I forget who we are
to have the next "referring to the bill.“Perhaps,” said Mr. Elliot, speaking quietly, “I had a longer
getting to know your character than you know."

"Indeed! How so? You could only have known him since I
arrived in Bath, except for what you may have heard of earlier in my
own family."

"I knew you from a report long before you came to Bath..I heard you
described by those who knew you intimately.I was familiar
with you by nature for many years.Your personality, your disposition
achievements, manners; they were all by my side."

Mr. Elliot was not disappointed with the interest he hoped to generate..Not
one can resist the charm of such a mystery.To be described
a long time ago for a recent acquaintance, from nameless people, irresistible;
and Ann had curiosity.She wondered and questioned him impatiently;
but in vain.He liked being asked, but he didn't say."No, no, maybe someday, but not now.He would not mention
names now; but such he could assure her was a fact.He had
many years ago received such a description of Miss Ann Elliot as
inspired him to a higher idea of ​​her virtues and excited
the hottest curiosity to know her."

Ann could not have imagined anyone who spoke with such partiality about
her many years ago as Mr. Wentworth of Monkford, Captain Wentworth
brother.He could have been with Mr. Elliot, but she didn’t
courage to ask a question.“The name Anne Elliot,” he said, “sounds interesting for a long time.
to me.Long ago he took possession of my fantasy; and if i
dare I would breathe my wishes so the name never changes."

So, in her opinion, were his words; but she barely got them
sound than her attention was attracted by other sounds directly behind
her, which made everything else trivial.Her father and lady
Dalrymple spoke.“A handsome man,” said Sir Walter, “a very handsome man.."

"Indeed, a very good young man!" said Lady Dalrymple."More air than
in Bath you can often see.Irish, dare I say."

"No, I just know his name.Worshiping acquaintance.Wentworth; Captain
Navy wentworth.His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire,
Croft filming Kellinch."

Even before Sir Walter got to this point, Anna's eyes caught
in the right direction, and the distinguished Captain Wentworth stood among
a group of men at a short distance.When her gaze fell on him, his
it seemed that she was abandoned.He looked like this.It seemed like
if she was a moment late; and while she dared to watch,
he did not look again: but the play resumed, and she
was forced to regain her focus on the orchestra and see
plain.When she got one more look, he walked away.He could not
would come closer to her if he wanted to; she was so surrounded and locked:
but she would rather catch his eye.Mr. Elliot's speech upset her too..She no longer had
tendency to talk to him.She wanted him not to be that close to her.The first act is over.Now she hoped for some useful change; as well as,
after a period of silence in the party, some of them
decide to go in search of tea.Anna was one of the few who did not
choose to move.She stayed where she was, and so did Lady Russell; but
she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr. Elliot; and she didn't mean
whatever she felt because of Lady Russell, shy away from
a conversation with Captain Wentworth if he gives her the opportunity.Lady Russell's face convinced her that she had seen him..However, he did not come.Sometimes it seemed to Anna that she noticed him.

unproductive.The others returned, the room was filled with benches again
were returned and returned to possession, and another hour of pleasure or
repentance had to be delayed, another hour of music had to please or
yawning because real or feigned love for her predominated.For Anna it is
mostly hoped for an hour of unrest.She couldn't quit
in this room in the world without seeing Captain Wentworth again, without
sharing one friendly look.There have been many changes in the refitting as a result of the fact that
what was beneficial for her.Colonel Wallis refused to sit down
again, and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret to
the manner not to refuse, to sit between them; and some others
removal and a little intrigue of her own, Ann was able to place
much closer to the edge of the bench than before, much
more within the reach of a passerby.She couldn't do it without
comparing herself to Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles; but
nevertheless she did it, and not much happier; although than
seemed like prosperity in the form of an early abdication of the throne in her next
neighbors, she was at the very end of the bench in front of
the concert is closed.Such was her position, when there was free space at hand, when the captain
Wentworth was in sight again.She saw him just around the corner.He saw her
also; however, he looked serious and hesitant, and only very slowly
degrees approached finally enough to talk to her.She felt that
something must be in this.The change was undeniable.IN
the difference between his present appearance and what was in the Octagon.
The room was amazingly great.Why was it? She thought about her father, oh
Lady russell.Could there be unpleasant looks? He started
speaking seriously about the concert, more like Captain Wentworth from
Uppercross; admitted himself disappointed, expected singing; And in
In short, I must confess that he shouldn't regret when it's over.Ann
answered, and spoke out so well in defense of the performance, and yet in
take into account his feelings so nicely that his face
improved and he answered again with almost a smile.They spoke
a few more minutes; improvement has taken place; he even looked at
a bench, as if he saw a place on it, worthy of taking it; when at the same time
an instant a touch on her shoulder made Anna turn around.It came
by Mr. Elliot.He asked her forgiveness, but she must be turned to
explain again in Italian.Miss Carteret really wanted
general idea of ​​what will be sung next.Ann could not refuse; but
she never sacrificed politeness with a more suffering spirit.A few minutes, though as short as possible, would inevitably go away; as well as
when her own mistress again, when she can turn and see how she
she had previously been contacted by Captain Wentworth at the reserved
still a hasty goodbye."He must say goodnight to her; he was
going; he must return home as soon as possible."

"Isn't this song worth staying for?" said Ann, suddenly startled
an idea that made her inspire even more."Not!" he replied impressively: "I have nothing to stay for";
and he left right.Envy of Mr. Elliot! It was the only intelligible motive.Captain
Wentworth is jealous of her love! Could she believe this week
ago; three hours ago! For a moment the satisfaction was exquisite.But alas! had very different thoughts to succeed.How was it
jealousy that needs to be appeased? How could the truth get to him? As in everything
specific shortcomings of their respective situations, could he
ever found out about her true feelings? It was a shame to think about mister
Elliot's attention.Their evil was incalculable.Chapter 21


The next morning, Anna happily remembered her promise to go to
Mrs Smith, meaning that she should keep her out of the house at a time when

almost the first object.She felt great benevolence towards him..Despite
mischief of his attention, she owed him gratitude and respect, perhaps
compassion.She couldn't help but think of the extraordinary
the circumstances of their acquaintance, the rights to which he
seemed to interest her in everyone in the situation, her own
sentiment, his early bias.Overall it was very
extraordinary; flattering but painful.There was something to regret.how
she might have thought if Captain Wentworth was not involved,

distribute cleansing and perfume completely.She was confident of a pleasant welcome; and her friend seemed like that
morning, especially due to her for coming, it seemed

memories of the concert were happy enough to revive her
facial features and make her happy by talking about it.All she could say
she spoke very willingly, but everything was not enough for the one who was
and unsatisfactory for a researcher like Mrs. Smith, who has

could connect, and who was now asking in vain for some details

know by name Mrs. Smith.“The little Durands were there, I come to the conclusion,” she said, “with my
mouths open to catch music like fledgling sparrows ready to be
fed.They never miss a concert."

"Yes, I have not seen them myself, but I heard that Mr. Elliot said that they were in
room."

“The Ibbotsons, were they there? And two new beauties with
a tall Irish officer spoken of as one of them."

"I dont know.I don't think they were."

Old Lady Mary McLean? I don't need to ask about her..She never misses, I
know; and you must have seen her.She must have been in your own
a circle; because when you traveled with Lady Dalrymple you took up seats
greatness, around the orchestra, of course."

"No, I was afraid of that.I would be very unpleasant
in every way.But luckily Lady Dalrymple always chooses
further; and we were very well disposed, that is, to hear;
I don't have to talk about what I saw because I seem to have seen very little."

"Oh! You've seen enough for your own amusement.I can understand.There
it is a kind of home entertainment that can be recognized even in a crowd, and this
you.You were a big company yourself and you didn't want anything
out."

“But I should have looked around more,” said Anna, realizing that
she said that there really was no shortage of finding that
only the object was defective."No, no, you better get settled.You don't need to tell me what you have
Pleasant evening.I can see it in your eyes.I can see perfectly how the clock
passed: that you always had something nice to listen to.in
concert intervals it was a conversation."

Ann half smiled and asked, "Do you see it in my eyes?"

"Yes.Your face tells me beautifully that you were in
company last night with the person you deem most pleasant in
the world, the person who interests you at the present time more than
the rest of the world together."

A blush covered Anna's cheeks..She couldn't say anything.“And in that case,” Mrs. Smith continued after a short pause, “I
I hope you believe that I really know how to appreciate your kindness by coming to
i am this morning.It's really very good of you to come and sit with
me when you must have so many nice demands on your time."

Ann didn't hear anything about it.She was still amazed and
confusion, excited by the penetration of a friend, can not imagine how
any report from Captain Wentworth could have reached her.After another
short silence -

“Pray,” said Mrs Smith, “if Mr. Elliot knows about your acquaintance with
me? Does he know I'm in Bath? "

"Mr. Elliot!" Anne repeated, looking up in surprise.Moment
reflection showed her the mistake she was.She caught it
instantly; and restoring your courage with a sense of security,
soon added in a more restrained manner: "Do you know Mr. Elliot?"

"I knew him well," replied Mrs Smith,
seriously "but now it looks worn out.It's been a long time since we met."

"I didn't know about it at all.You've never mentioned this before.If I
knew it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you."

"I confess the truth," said Mrs. Smith, assuming her usual appearance.
cheerfulness ", this is exactly the pleasure that I want you to get.I want to

can do me a significant service; and if you had good,

Done."

"I will be very happy; I hope you do not doubt my readiness
- answered Anna, - but I suspect that
you think I have a higher claim to Mr. Elliot,
the right to influence him than it really is.I'm sure you have,
anyway, absorbed such a concept.You should only see me as
Mr Elliot's relationship.If there is anything in this light that you
suppose his cousin rightly asks him, I beg you not to
hesitate to hire me."

Mrs. Smith gave her a piercing look, and then, smiling, said:

"I was a little premature as far as I understand; sorry.I
should have waited for official information.But now my dear miss
Elliot, like an old friend, tells me when I can speak.Next week? Of course, by next week I'll be allowed to think it over
made up his mind, and make his own selfish plans for Mr.Elliot's luck."

“No,” replied Anna, “not next week, not next, not next..I assure you
that nothing you think about will be resolved any week.I'm not going to marry Mr. Elliot.I would like to know why you

know him better than Colonel Wallis? "

"My dear Mrs. Smith, Mr. Elliot's wife has died a little more than half
year.He doesn't have to pay addresses to anyone.

“Oh, if that's your only objection,” Mrs. Smith exclaimed slyly.
Elliot is safe and I won't worry about him anymore.Do
don't forget me when you get married, that's all.Let him know that I will
your friend, and then he thinks little about trouble
required, which is now very natural for him, with so many things to do
and his own activities, which he should avoid and get rid of as much as possible; highly
naturally possible.Ninety nine out of a hundred would do the same.Of
of course, he cannot realize the importance to me.Well my dear miss
Elliot, I hope and believe that you will be very happy.Mister Elliot makes sense
understand the value of such a woman.Your peace will not be
shipwrecked like mine.You are safe in all worldly affairs, and
safe in his nature.He does not go astray; he will not
misled by others to his doom."

“No,” said Ann, “I easily believe everything my cousin says..It
seems to have a calm, determined character, not at all open to dangers
impression.I regard him with great respect..I have no reason
from everything that came into my field of observation to act differently.But I did not know him for long; and he is not a man I think to be
it will be known soon.I won't talk about him like that, mrs.
Smith, can I convince you that he means nothing to me? Surely it should be calm
enough.And honestly, he means nothing to me.Should he ever
suggest to me (that I have very little reason to believe that he has
thought to do), I will not accept it.I assure you I won't.I assure you, Mr. Elliot did not have the share that you
Suppose, no matter how enjoyable yesterday's concert may have been:
not Mr. Elliot; this is not Mr. Elliot ... "

She stopped, blushing deeply, regretting what she had said so much about;
but less would hardly be enough.Mrs. Smith unlikely
so quickly believed in Mr.Elliot's failure, but
is there someone else.As it was, she immediately presented
and seemingly not seeing anything beyond; and ann, thirsty
avoid further attention, anxiously awaited an answer why Mrs. Smith
imagined that she would marry Mr. Elliot; where could she get
idea, or who she might have heard it from."Tell me how it first occurred to you."

“It first occurred to me,” replied Mrs Smith, “when I found out how much
you were together and considered it the most likely
the world that all who belong to any of you would desire; and you
may depend on the fact that all your acquaintances got rid of you in
same.But I never heard of it until two days ago."

"And was it really said about it?"

"You noticed the woman who opened the door for you when you called
yesterday?"

"Not.Isn't that Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid? I didn't see anyone
in particular."

"It was my friend Mrs. Rook, Rook's nurse, who, by the way, is wonderful
curiosity to see you, and was glad to be on the way to let you in.She only left the Marlborough Buildings on Sunday; and she was
Who told me that you would marry Mr. Elliot.She got it from Mrs
Wallis herself, who didn't seem like a bad authority.She sat for an hour with
i'm monday night and gave me the whole story."" Whole
history, Anna repeated, laughing.."She couldn't be long
the story, I think, of one such small article of baseless news."

Mrs Smith said nothing.“But,” Anne continued, “although in my
having this right to Mr. Elliot, I would be extremely happy
use for you in any way that I could.Should I mention your existence to him
in the bathroom? May I receive any message? "

"No, I thank you: no, of course not.In the warmth of the moment, and
under the mistaken impression, I might perhaps try
interest you in some circumstances; but not right now.No thanks i
I have nothing to worry about."

"I think you were talking about knowing Mr. Elliot for many years?"

"I did."

"Not before I got married, I suppose?"

"Yes, he was not married when I first met him."

"And - did you know each other well?"

"Intimacy."

"Indeed! Then tell me who he was at that time of his life.I have
great curiosity to know who Mr. Elliot was in his youth.He was
generally the way it appears now? "

“I haven't seen Mr. Elliot in all these three years,” Mrs. Smith replied.
given so seriously that it was impossible to continue the discussion of this topic;
and Ann felt she had achieved nothing but an increase in curiosity..Both were silent: Mrs. Smith is very thoughtful..Finally--

"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot," she exclaimed in her natural
tone of cordiality: "I apologize for the short answers I have
gave you, but I didn't know what to do.I have
doubted and pondered what I have to tell you.There
there was a lot to take into account.I hate to be
officious, make a bad impression, cause harm.Even
the smooth surface of the family union seems to be worth preserving, although

right; I think you should get to know the present
the character.Although I totally believe that you currently don't have
the slightest intention to accept it, one cannot say that it can
happen.At some point, you may feel differently about
his.Hear the truth now while you are impartial.Mr
Elliot is a man without heart and conscience; design, alert,
a cold-blooded creature who thinks only of himself; who for his
interest or lightness, will be guilty of any cruelty or betrayal,
what could have been done without risking its general nature.It
does not feel for others.The ones he was the main reason
leading to destruction, he can neglect and leave without the slightest
remorse.He is completely out of reach of any sense.
justice or compassion.Oh! he is black in the shower, empty and black! "

Anna's surprised look and her delighted exclamation made her stop and
she added in a calmer tone,

"My expression scares you.You have to let the wounded, angry
female.But I'll try to command myself.I will not insult him.I
I will only tell you that I found it.The facts speak.He was
a close friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him, and
thought he was as good as himself.Intimacy was formed before
our marriage.I found their closest friends; and I also became
overly pleased with Mr Elliot and was of the highest opinion
his.You know, at nineteen, a person doesn't think very seriously; but
Mr. Elliot seemed to me as good as the others, and more.
nicer than most others and we were almost always together.we
were mainly in the city, lived in a very good style.He was then
defective in circumstances; he was poor then; he had cameras in
Temple, and that was all he could do to maintain the appearance
gentleman.He always had a home with us whenever he chose it; is he
always welcomed; he was like a brother.My poor Charles, who has
the finest, most generous spirit in the world would have shared it
the last penny with him; and I know that his wallet was open to him; I
I know that he often helped him."

“It must have been about that very period in Mr. Elliot’s life,” said
Ann "who always piqued my particular curiosity.It should be
it was around the same time that he became known to my father and sister.I never knew him myself; I've only heard of him; but there was something
in his behavior towards my father and sister, and
subsequently under the circumstances of his marriage, which I never could
be quite reconciled with the present tense.Seemed to have announced something else
type of person."

“I know all this, I know all this,” exclaimed Mrs Smith.."He was
introduced Sir Walter and your sister before I met
him but I heard him talk about them forever.I know he was invited and
inspired and I know he didn't go.I can satisfy you
perhaps on items that you are unlikely to expect; and as for him
marriage, I knew all about it at the time.I was dedicated with all my might
and against; I was a friend to whom he shared his hopes and plans;
and although I did not know his wife before, her situation is worse
in society, indeed, made it impossible, but I knew her all of her
life after that, or at least until the last two years of her
life, and I can answer any question you want to ask."

“No,” Ann said, “I have no particular questions about her..I
always understood that they were not a happy couple.But I would like
to know why at that time of his life he should neglect my father
acquaintance like him.My father, of course, was very
kind and proper notice of it.Why did Mr. Elliot back down? "

“Mr Elliot,” replied Mrs Smith, “during that period of her life
goal: to make a fortune and through a faster process
than the law.He was determined to make it through marriage.He was
decided, at least, not to spoil him with an unreasonable marriage; and I
know that it was his faith (fair or not, of course, I cannot
decide) that your father and sister are in their courtesy and
invitations, formalized the marriage between the heir and the young
lady, and it was impossible for such a match to answer his
ideas of wealth and independence.This was his motive for painting
back I can assure you.He told me the whole story.He didn't have
hiding with me.I was curious what you just quit
I'm in Bath, my first and main acquaintance with marriage should be
Your cousin; and that through him I must constantly hear about
your father and sister.He described one to Miss Elliot and I thought
very tenderly another."

“Perhaps,” Ann exclaimed, caught up in a sudden idea, “you sometimes talked about
me Mr. Elliot? "

"Of course, I very often.I used to brag about my Anna Elliot,
and I guarantee that you are a completely different creature from ... "

She checked herself just in time."This explains what Mr. Elliot said last night," exclaimed
Ann."This explains.I found he was used to hearing about me.I
couldn't figure out how.What wild fantasies are formed where dear
worries myself! How sure to be wrong! But I beg your pardon; I
interrupted you.Mr. Elliot got married entirely for money?
Circumstances that probably first opened your eyes to his
the character."

Mrs Smith hesitated a little."Oh it's too common.When someone lives in this world, marry a man or woman for money too
business as usual to hit hard.I was very young and associated
only with the young, and we were a frivolous, cheerful company, without any
strict rules of conduct.We lived for pleasure.I think otherwise
now; time, sickness and sorrow gave me different ideas; but in
I must confess that at that time I saw nothing reprehensible in the fact that Mr.
did.“Doing everything possible for oneself” was considered a duty.."

"But wasn't she a very short woman?"

"Yes, which I objected to, but he did not consider.Money, money was
all he wanted.Her father was a herder, her grandfather was a herder.
butcher, but it's nothing.She was a beautiful woman, had
decent education, promoted by cousins, accidentally abandoned
with Mr. Elliot's company and fell in love with him; but not
difficulties or doubts were on his side in relation to her
birth.All his caution was spent trying to get the real amount.
her fortune before he devoted himself.Rely on it, whatever
the respect that Mr. Elliot can have for his own life situation now that
man, he didn't make the slightest difference to this.His chance at Kellinch
the estate was something, but all the honor of the family, which he considered cheap
like dirt.I have often heard him say that if the baronies were
sold, anyone should have it for fifty pounds, a weapon and a motto,
name and livery included; but I won't repeat half of what I am
heard him talk about this before.It would be unfair; and still
you must have proof, because it is everything but the statement, and you
must have proof."

"Indeed, my dear Mrs. Smith, I do not want anything," Ann exclaimed.."You have
did not assert anything contrary to what Mr Elliot seemed to be
many years ago.All this is rather a confirmation that we are used to
hear and believe.I'm more curious to know why he has to be like this
another now."

"But, to my delight, if you have the kindness to call
Mary; Stay: I'm sure you will receive even more kindness
walk into my bedroom and bring me a small inlaid box
which you will find on the top shelf of the cabinet."

Ann, seeing that her friend was genuinely inclined towards this, did what she wanted.
desired.The box was brought in and placed in front of her, and Mrs. Smith,
sighing over it as she unlocked it, said:

"This place is full of papers belonging to him, my husband; a small
only a fraction of what i had to inspect when i lost it.Letter I
I'm looking was written by Mr. Elliot to him before our marriage,
and happened to be saved; why is it hard to imagine.But he was
casually and impartially, like other men, to these things; and when
I came to look at his papers, I found it in others.
trite, from different people scattered here and there, while many
letters and memoranda of real importance were destroyed.This
is an; I would not burn it, because even then I was very little satisfied.
Elliot and I were determined to preserve all the documents of the former
closeness.Now I have another reason to be happy about what I can produce.
it."

It was a letter addressed to "Charles Smith, Esq..Tunbridge Wells "
and dated London July 1803:

"Dear Smith, I got your.Your kindness almost triumphs
me.I wish nature would make hearts like yours more widespread, but I
have lived in the world for twenty-three years and have not seen anything like it
it.At the present time, believe me, I do not need your services, being in
cash again.Give me joy: I got rid of Sir Walter and Miss.They are
returned to Kellinch, and almost made me swear to visit them in this
in summer; but the first time I come to Kellinch with a surveyor to say
me how to bring it to the maximum benefit to the hammer.Baronet,
however, it is possible that I will marry again; he is fool enough.However, if he does, they will leave me alone, which might be decent
equivalent to return.It's worse than last year."I wish I had a name other than Elliot.I am tired of this.Name
Walter, I might fall, thank God! and I want you to never insult me
with my second W.again, that is, for the rest of your life, be only
Regards, - Wm.Elliot."

Such a letter could not be read without awakening Anna's radiance; and mrs
Smith, noticing the bright blush on her face, said:

"I know the language is very disrespectful..Although I forgot
exact terms, I have a fine idea of ​​the general meaning.But he shows you a man.Mark his professions for my poor husband.What could be stronger? "

Anne could not immediately overcome the shock and chagrin.
find words like this applied to her father.She was forced to remember
that the fact that she saw the letter was a violation of the laws of honor, that
no one should be judged or recognized by such evidence that no
private correspondence could withstand the views of others before it could
calm enough to return the letter she
meditating and say:

"Thank you.This is undoubtedly complete proof; proof of everything that you
spoke.But why meet us now? "

“I can explain it too,” exclaimed Mrs Smith, smiling.."Can you really?"

"Yes.I showed you, Mr. Elliot, what he was a dozen years ago, and I
will show him as he is now.I cannot provide written evidence again, but
I can give as reliable oral evidence as you wish about who he is.
now wants, and what is he doing now.Now he's not a hypocrite.It
really wants to marry you.His current attention to your family
very sincerely: quite from the heart.I will pass on my authority to you: his
friend Colonel Wallis."

"Colonel Wallis! Do you know him?"

"Not.It doesn't come to me in that literal sense; it
takes a turn or two, but nothing big.Stream is just as good
as at first; the little trash it picks up around corners is easy
moved.Elliot speaks unconditionally with Colonel Wallis about his
the glances at you that Colonel Wallis said, I suppose that in itself
prudent, cautious, perceptive character; but Colonel Wallis
very pretty stupid wife, to whom he tells what is best for him
no, and he repeats everything to her.She's in a crowded spirit
her recovery, repeats everything to the nurse; and the nurse knowing my
meeting you very naturally brings me all this.On Monday
in the evening, my good friend Mrs. Rook allowed me to learn so much about secrets
Marlborough Buildings.So when I talked about the whole story,
You see, I'm not as romantic as you thought."

"My dear Mrs. Smith, your authority is insufficient.It won't go.Mr
That Elliot has any opinion of me does not in any way explain
the effort he made to reconcile with my father.It's all
before my arrival in Bath.I found them on my friendliest relationship
when i arrived."

"I know you did it; I know all this perfectly well, but ..."

"Indeed, Mrs. Smith, we should not expect to receive real information in such
line.Facts or opinions that must go through the hands
many who are deluded by stupidity in one thing and ignorance in another may
hardly much truth remains."

"Just listen to me.Soon you will be able to judge the general
to pay by listening to some of the details you can yourself
immediately disprove or confirm.Nobody thinks you were his
first impulse.He actually saw you before he came to Bath, and
admired you, but not knowing that it was you.That's what my historian says
at least.It's true? Did he see you last summer or fall
"Somewhere in the west" using her own words without knowing it
to be you? "

"He definitely did.As long as it's true.In Lyme.I ended up
in Lyme."

“Well,” Mrs. Smith continued triumphantly, “give my friend his due.
in connection with the establishment of the first approved clause.He saw you then
in Lyme, and I liked you so much that we were extremely happy to meet
with you again to Camden Place as Miss Anne Elliot, and from there
the moment, I have no doubt, had a twofold motive in his visits there.But
there was another, and earlier, which I will now explain.If here
is there anything in my history that you know as a lie or
incredible stop me.My account says your sister's friend,
the lady who now lives with you, whom I heard you mentioned, came to Bath
with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter back in September (in short, when
they first came themselves) and has remained there ever since;
that she is an intelligent, insinuating, beautiful woman, poor and believable,
and in general such in the situation and manner, to give a general idea,
among Sir Walter's acquaintances that she wants to be Lady Elliot, and
in general, it is surprising that Miss Elliot apparently does not notice
danger."

Here Mrs Smith paused for a moment; but Ann didn't say a word and she
continued -

"It was a light in which it seemed to those who knew the family,
long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eyes on
your father is enough to understand this, although he did not then visit
at Camden Place; but his respect for Mr. Elliot sparked his interest in
watching everything that happened there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath
for a day or two, as he did shortly before Christmas,
Colonel Wallis introduced him to the appearance of things and
reports start to prevail.Now you must understand that this time
significantly changed Mr.Elliot's opinion regarding
value of the barony.On all points of blood and communication, he
completely changed person.Having as much money as I could
spend, nothing to wish for because of greed or condescension, he has
gradually learned to associate his happiness with the consequences that he
heir.I thought this would happen even before our acquaintance ended, but this
now a confirmed feeling.He can’t bear the thought that he’s not sir.
William.You can guess that the news he heard from his
the friend could not be very nice, and you can guess what he produced;
the decision to return to Bath as soon as possible and
settling here for a while, in order to resume their previous
acquaintance and restoration in the family of such a position that could give
him a means of determining the degree of his danger and
bypass the lady if he considers it essential.It was agreed
between two friends as the only thing to do; and colonel
Wallis had to help as much as he could..It should have been
introduced, and Mrs. Wallis was to be introduced, and everyone was to
to be introduced.Mr. Elliot returned accordingly; and on request was
forgiven, as you know, and again accepted into the family and this is
was his constant target, and his only target (before your arrival added
another motive) to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.He missed no
the opportunity to be with them, rushed in their path, urged
all hours; but I don't need to go into details about this.You can
imagine what a cunning person would do; and with this guide maybe
remember what you saw how he did."

“Yes,” said Ann, “you don’t tell me anything that doesn’t correspond to what
I knew or could have imagined.There is always something hurtful about
trick details.Maneuvers of selfishness and duplicity
must be disgusting, but I haven't heard anything that really surprises
me.I know those who would be shocked by such an image of the master
Elliot, who would find it hard to believe; but i never
was satisfied.I always wanted some other motive for his behavior.
how did.I would like to know his current opinion regarding
the likelihood of an event he feared; does he think
the danger will decrease or not."

"Downsizing, I understand," replied Mrs Smith.."He thinks Mrs Clay
afraid of him, realizes that he sees right through, and does not dare
act as she might have done in his absence.But since he must be absent
at times I don’t understand how he can be safe as long as
she keeps her current influence.Mrs Wallis has a funny idea since
the nurse tells me to include this in marriage clauses when
you and Mr. Elliot are getting married so that your father does not marry Mrs. Clay.BUT
a scheme worthy of understanding Mrs. Wallis, apparently; but my
sane nurse Rook sees the absurdity of this.'Why, of course
ma'am, '' she said, `` that will not prevent him from marrying someone else.'
And really, to be honest, I don't think there is a nurse in her heart
very energetic opponent of Sir Walter having a second match.She must
you're allowed to be in marriage, you know; and (since I
will invade) who can say that she may not have some flying visions
visit the next Lady Elliot on Mrs. Wallis's recommendation? "

“I am very glad to know all this,” Anna said after a while.
brooding."In some ways it will hurt me more
in company with him, but I know better what to do.My line
behavior will be more direct.Mr Elliot is clearly disingenuous
artificial, worldly man who never had a better principle
lead him than selfishness."

But Mr. Elliot is not finished.Mrs. Smith carried away
her first direction, which Anna forgot about in her own interests
family concerns, how much was originally implied against him; but
now her attention was drawn to the explanation of those first hints,
and she listened to the concert, which, if not fully justified
Mrs Smith's unconditional bitterness proved that he was very
insensitive in his behavior towards her; very imperfect as in justice
and compassion.She learned that (the intimate relationship between them continues without prejudice to Mr.
Elliot) they were always together as before, and Mr.
Elliot dragged his friend into expenses far exceeding his fortune..Mrs
Smith did not want to blame herself and was very fond of
throw something at your husband; but Ann could get their income
were never equal to their lifestyle, and this is from the first
there was a lot of shared and shared wastefulness.Of
his wife's story about him she could understand that Mr Smith was a man
warm feelings, light disposition, careless habits and weak
understanding, much friendlier than his friend, and very different from him,
led by him and probably despised by him.Mister Elliot raised him
marriage to great prosperity and inclined to all satisfaction
pleasure and vanity that could be controlled without interfering with it,
(for for all his indulgence in his weaknesses, he became a prudent man), and
becoming rich as his friend should have
being poor, it seemed, did not care at all that the friend
probable finances, but, on the contrary, encouraged and
encouraging spending that can end in ruin; and blacksmiths
was destroyed accordingly.Husband died just in time to get rid of full knowledge
it.They knew enough embarrassment before to try
friendship of their friends, and prove that Mr Elliot is better
not be judged; but only after his death a miserable state
his affairs were fully known.With confidence in the respect of Mr. Elliot,
more worthy of his feelings than his judgment, Mr. Smith
appointed him the executor of his will; but Mr. Elliot didn't act,
and the difficulties and suffering that this refusal brought down on her,
in addition to the inevitable suffering associated with her situation, she had to
such that it was impossible to talk about without mental anguish or listen
without corresponding indignation.Anna on this occasion was shown several of his letters, replies to urgent
statements from Mrs. Smith, who all breathed equally harshly
the decision not to deal with fruitless troubles, but with a cold
politeness, the same cruel indifference to any of the evils,
may bring on her.It was a terrible picture of ingratitude and
inhumanity; and Ann at some moments felt that there was no blatant open crime
could be worse.She had something to listen to; everything
details of past sad scenes, all the little things of grief on
calamities that had been hinted at in earlier conversations were
stopped now with natural indulgence.Anne could perfectly
understood exquisite relief, and was only more inclined to
wonder at the calmness of her friend's usual state of mind.In the history of her complaints about
particular irritation.She had good reason to believe that some
her husband's property in the West Indies, which for many
years under a kind of sequestration to pay for their own
encumbrances can be removed by appropriate measures; and this
property, although small, would be sufficient to
rich.But there was no one to move.Mister Elliot will do nothing
and she could not do anything herself, equally disabled due to personal
her physical weakness and the use of others
her lack of money.She had no natural connections to help her even
with her lawyer and she couldn't afford to buy help
of the law.It was a brutal exacerbation of virtually constrained funds..To feel like she should be in better circumstances
trouble in the right place might do it, and fear that the delay might
even weakening her pretensions, it was hard to bear.It was here that she hoped to enlist Anna's good offices.
with mr elliot.She used to wait for them
marriage, was very afraid of losing a girlfriend because of this; but on
convinced that he could not make any attempt of this kind, since
he did not even suspect that she was in Bath, it immediately became clear that
something could be done in her favor under the influence of the woman he
loved, and she hastily prepared to interest Anna's feelings,
as far as the rites of character of Mr. Elliot allowed,
when Anna's denial of the alleged engagement changed the face
everything; and while it took away from her newly formed hope for
succeeding in her first alarm, left her at least
the comfort of telling the whole story in your own way.After listening to this full description of Mr. Elliot, Ann was unable to
but express some surprise that Mrs. Smith is so about him
favorably at the beginning of a conversation."She seemed
recommend and praise it! "

“My dear,” Mrs. Smith replied, “there was nothing else to do..I thought that you would marry him as a certainty, although he may not have
made an offer, and I could no longer speak the truth about him than if he
was your husband.My heart was bleeding for you when I talked about
happiness; and yet he is reasonable, he is pleasant, and with such
a woman like you, it was not completely hopeless.He was very unfriendly to
his first wife.They were unhappy together.But she was too ignorant
and dizzy with respect and he never loved her.I was ready
hope you feel better."

Anne could simply admit to herself the opportunity to have
was forced to marry him because she shuddered at the thought that
the suffering that was to follow.It is possible that she could

which would be very sad if time is everything too
late?

It was highly desirable that Lady Russell no longer be deceived;
and one of the closing events of this important conference,
who spent most of the morning was that
Anya had complete freedom to inform her friend about everything that related to her.
Mrs Smith, in what his behavior was implicated.Chapter 22


Ann went home to think over everything she heard.At some point her
feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr. Elliot.Did not have
nothing more out of tenderness because of him.He stood in contrast to
Captain Wentworth, for all his unwanted obsession; and evil
his attention last night, the irreparable harm he could have done
done, considered sensations unskilled, not puzzled.A pity
it was over for him.But that was the only relief.In each
in another respect, looking around or penetrating forward, she saw
no longer trust and fear.She was worried about
the disappointment and pain that Lady Russell will experience; for
humiliation that must have hung over her father and sister, and
there were all the troubles to foresee a lot of evil, not knowing how
prevent any of them.She was very grateful for her own knowledge
his.She never considered herself eligible for a reward for
neglecting an old friend like Mrs. Smith, but it was really a reward
follows from this! Mrs. Smith was able to tell her that no one
otherwise I could have done.Could knowledge be expanded through
her family? But it was a futile idea.She must speak to Lady Russell,
tell her, consult with her and, having done everything possible, wait for the event
as coolly as possible; and in the end, her greatest desire is
self-control would be in that part of the mind that could not be
opened Lady Russell; in the stream of anxiety and fears that should
be completely for yourself.Upon reaching the house, she found that she had escaped as expected.

visit; but as soon as she congratulated herself and felt safe when
she heard that he will come again tonight.“I had no intention of asking him,” Elizabeth said.

least."

"Indeed, I say this.I've never seen anyone harder in my life

cruel sister, Miss Ann seems to be violent."

"Oh!" Elizabeth exclaimed. - I'm too used to the game to
to be soon gripped by gentlemanly allusions.However, when I found out how
he regretted overly that he missed my father in this
in the morning, I immediately gave in because I would never miss
the opportunity to bring him and Sir Walter together.They seem like this
great advantage in company with each other.Everyone behaves like this
pleasantly.Mister Elliot looks up with such respect."

"Pretty delicious!" exclaimed Mrs Clay, but did not dare to turn her
eyes on Anna.“Just like father and son! Dear Miss Elliot,
can I not say father and son? "

"Oh! I do not put an embargo on anyone's words.If you have such
ideas! But, honestly, I hardly notice his attention.

"My dear Miss Elliot!" exclaimed Mrs Clay, raising her hands and eyes,
and plunging all the rest of my surprise into comfortable silence."Well, my dear Penelope, you shouldn't be so worried about him..I did
invite him you know.I sent him away with a smile.When i found him
really going to see my friends in Thornberry Park for the whole day
tomorrow I took pity on him."

Ann admired her friend's good acting, who could show such
pleasure, as she did, in anticipation and in real arrival
the very person whose presence should really interfere with her
main object.It was impossible, but Mrs. Clay must have hated the sight.
Mr. Elliot; and yet she could assume the most helpful, serene air,
and seem to be quite satisfied with the reduced license for
she is only half the size of Sir Walter than she would
otherwise.It was very unpleasant for Anna herself to see Mr.

carry out the necessary communication; and she would leave
right after breakfast, but Mrs. Clay was also going to

You can take that tedious book she lent me and

While her father spoke, there was a knock on the door.Who could it

Elliot, would have expected him, but for his famous engagement

a clear report on the whole; the story in which she saw the great

Captain Harville's first impulse to come to Bath for
business.He started talking about it a week ago; and by doing
something, when the shooting was over, Charles offered to go with him,

Mr. Musgrove and Louise at Uppercross.Anna's only surprise was that things had to be assertive enough.

owners, each more careful and jealous than the other; and two
of at least three, Charles Hayter could have received a special
recommendation.Not that he appreciates it the way he should, ”he remarked.
"Charles is too cool about sports.This is the worst of it."

“I’m really very glad,” Anna exclaimed, “I’m especially glad that this
should happen; and two sisters who both deserve equally well,
and who have always been such good friends, nice prospect
one should not overshadow those of the other - that they should be so

quite happy with both."

"O yes.My father would be very pleased if gentlemen

“Such wonderful parents as Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove,” Anne exclaimed.
"should be happy in the marriage of their children.They do everything to
give happiness, I'm sure.What a blessing for young people to be in
such hands! Your father and mother seem to be completely free of all these
the ambitious feelings that led to such misdeeds and misfortunes,
both young and old.I hope you think Louise is fully recovered
now?"

He answered hesitantly: “Yes, I think so; highly

her influence was sufficiently increased by their beautiful

Mrs. Musgrove and all her company should be invited to dine with them; but
she could not bear the differences in styles, contractions

between decency and vanity; but vanity got the better of it, and then
Elizabeth was happy again.These were her inner convictions: “Old
sculpted performances; country hospitality; we do not claim to give
lunches; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does that; not even
ask her sister's family, even though they have been here a month: and I dare

come; and she couldn't get more gratifying attention.Miss Elliot had the honor of visiting Mrs Musgrove at
the course of the morning; and Ann left with Charles and Mary to go
and see her and Henrietta directly.Her plan to sit with Lady Russell is to make way for the present..All three of them stopped at Rivers Street for a couple of minutes; but
Ann convinced herself that the day's delay in the alleged message
could not make any difference, and hastened to the White Deer, so that

zeal for goodwill, which has formed in many associations..They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter inside and on their own, and

amused, as she usually was, at her workplace by the window overlooking

the hotel provided a fast-paced, hectic scene.One five minutes
brought a note, the next package; and Anna was not even half there

filled: a company of old friends gathered around Mrs Musgrove,
and Charles returned with Captains Harville and Wentworth.IN

again.Their last meeting was the most important in the opening of his
feelings; she drew from this a delightful conviction; but she
feared, judging by his appearance, of the ill-fated conviction that

seems to want to be close enough to talk.She tried to calm down and leave it as it is, and tried
dwell on the argument of rational dependence: - “Of course, if
there must be constant affection on each side, our hearts must understand
each other very soon.We are not a boy or a girl to be meticulous
irritable, deluded by every moment of inattention and mindlessly playing
with our own happiness."And yet, after a few minutes, she felt
as if they were in company with each other, in their present
circumstances could only expose them to unintended actions and
delusions of the most harmful kind.“Ann,” Mary exclaimed, still standing by the window, “I'm sure this is Mrs. Clay,
standing under the colonnade, and with her the lord.i saw them
turn the corner from Bath Street now.They seemed carried away by the conversation.Who is it? Go and tell me.Oh my God! I remember.This is mister
Elliot himself."

“No,” Anne exclaimed quickly, “this cannot be Mr. Elliot, I assure you..It
was supposed to leave Bath at nine in the morning and won't be back until
tomorrow."

As she spoke, she felt Captain Wentworth watching her,
the realization of this irritated and embarrassed her and made her regret
that she said so much, how simple.Mary, offended that she should not know her cousin,
began to talk very passionately about family characteristics and protest
even more certain, it was Mr. Elliot who called Ann again

disappeared on one side, and Mrs. Clay quickly left on the other;
and checking the surprise that she could not help but feel at such

of the opposite interest, she calmly said: "Yes, this is Mr. Elliot, of course.I guess he changed the hour of departure, that's all, or maybe I

away, and then grimaced at them and insulted them for coming, began
with--

Mrs Musgrove humorously began to express her beautiful

Mary interrupted her impatiently, exclaiming:

“Oh my God, Charles! How could you come up with such a thing? Take the box.
for tomorrow night! Have you forgotten that we are engaged to Camden?
Tomorrow night? and that we were especially asked to meet
Lady Dalrymple and her daughter and Mr. Elliot and all
family ties to get to know them? How can you be
so forgetful? "

"Fu! Fu!" replied Charles, "What is an evening party? Never worth
remembering.Your father could invite us to dinner, I think if he
wanted to see us.You can do what you want, but I'll go to
play."

"Oh! Charles, I declare that it will be too disgusting if you do this when you
promised to go."

"No, I didn't promise.I just grinned and bowed and said the word
'happy.'There was no promise."

"But you have to go, Charles.It would be unforgivable to fail.We were
asked specifically to be introduced.Was always so wonderful
the connection between the Dalrymples and us.Nothing happened
on both sides, which was not announced immediately.We are very close
relationships, you know; and Mr. Elliot, whom you especially should

my father's heir: future representative of the family."

“Don't tell me about heirs and representatives,” Charles exclaimed.."I
I am not one to disregard the dominant power to bow to rebellion
the sun.If I hadn't gone for your father, I would have thought
scandalous to go for the sake of his heir.What is Mr. Elliot to me? "
The careless expression on her face was life for Anna, who saw that the captain
Wentworth was completely attentive, watching and listening with all his soul;
and that the last words made his questioning look of Charles pay attention to
herself.Charles and Mary still spoke in the same style; he is semi-serious
and half in jest, adhering to the scheme of the play, and she,
invariably serious, the most ardent opponent and not missing
it is known that, no matter how determined she was to go to Camden Place, she
shouldn't think that she was used very well if they went to the play
without her.Mrs Musgrove intervened.."We'd better put it off..Charles, you better get back and
change the box for tuesday.It would be a shame to split up, but we
Miss Ann must also lose if her father is having a party;
and I'm sure neither Henrietta nor I should care about the play at all,
if Miss Ann couldn't be with us."

Ann felt sincerely indebted to her for such kindness; and even more
for giving her the opportunity to decisively say:

"If it only depended on my addiction, ma'am, party at home
(except in the case of Mary) would not be the slightest obstacle.I

done, knowing that her words are being listened to, and not even daring

only retaining the advantage of teasing his wife, stubbornly
that he will go to the play tomorrow if no one else.Captain Wentworth left his seat and went to the fireplace; probably
in order to leave him soon afterwards and accept

Chapter 23


Only one day had passed since Anna's conversation with Mrs. Smith; but
showed even more interest and now Mr.
Elliot's behavior, except for its consequences in the one quarter that it became
needless to say the next morning to postpone her explanation
visit to Rivers Street.She promised to be with the Musgroves from
from breakfast to dinner.Her faith was undermined and Mr. Elliot
the character, like the head of the Sultana Scheherazade, must live differently
day.However, she could not come to the appointment on time; weather was
unfavorable, and she grieved because of the rain on her friends
account, and felt it very strongly before she could
try to walk.When she got to the White Deer and headed for
suitable apartment, she found that she did not arrive on time,
not the first to arrive.There were parties before her, Mrs Musgrove
talking to Mrs. Croft and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; as well as
she immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta were too impatient to wait,
went out the moment it cleared, but I'll be back soon,
and that the strictest prohibitions were left by Mrs Musgrove

be outwardly calm and immediately immerse yourself in everything

closed until morning.There was no delay, no waste of time.She is
was deep in the happiness of such suffering or in the suffering of such
happiness, instantly.Two minutes after she entered the room, the captain
Wentworth said:

"We will write the letter we spoke of, Harville, now if you
will give me materials."

The materials were at hand, on a separate table; he came to this, and almost
turning his back on everyone, was engrossed in writing.Mrs. Musgrove told Mrs. Croft the story of her eldest daughter.
engagement, and precisely in that uncomfortable tone of voice that was
perfectly audible while he pretended to whisper.Ann felt that
she did not participate in the conversation, and yet, like Captain Harville
seemed thoughtful and not inclined to talk, she could not help but hear
many unwanted details; such as "like Mr. Musgrove and my brother
Hayter met over and over again to discuss this; that my brother hater
said once, and that Mr. Musgrove proposed the next day, and that
it occurred to my sister Hayter, and what the young people wanted,
and what I said at first, I could never agree, but then it was
convinced to think maybe very good ", and much in the same
open communication style: little things that even with everyone
the advantage of taste and sophistication, which the kind Mrs Musgrove could not
give, can be really interesting only to managers.Mrs Croft
was present with great humor, and when she spoke at all, it
it was very reasonable.Ann hoped that each of the gentlemen would be too

in general, we did not consider it fair to stand out more, because
Charles Hayter was delighted with this, and Henrietta was very close.
so bad; and so we thought that it would be better for them to get married right away and force
best of all, like many others before them.Anyway, I said,
it will be better than a long engagement."

“This is exactly what I was going to observe,” exclaimed Mrs. Croft.."I
would prefer young people to immediately settle for a small income,
will have to deal with several difficulties together than participate in
long engagement.I always think that there is no mutual ... "

"ABOUT! Dear Mrs Croft! " Mrs Musgrove exclaimed, unable to let her finish her off.
speech "there is nothing that I hate so much for young people as a long
engagement.This is what I have always protested against for my children.it
I said that everything is good for young people to study if
have confidence that they can be married in six months, or
even at twelve; but a long engagement ... "

"Yes, dear ma'am," said Mrs. Croft, "or a vague engagement,
engagement that can be long.To begin with, not knowing that with this
once there is a way to marry, I think it is very unsafe and
unreasonable, and I think that all parents should prevent, as much as they can."

Ann found unexpected interest here.She felt it applied to
she herself, in a nervous trembling, felt it all over her body; and at the same time
the moment when her eyes instinctively looked at the distant table,
Captain Wentworth's handle stopped moving, his head was raised to a stop,
listening, and in the next instant he turned to look, alone
a quick, deliberate look at her.The two ladies kept on talking, repeating the same admitted truths,
and support them with such examples of the harmful effects of the opposite

it was due to a complete lack of mind, it gradually became clear that he
invited her to join him where he stood.He looked at her with
a smile and a slight movement of the head, expressing: “Come to me, I
have something to say; "and the laid-back, easy kindness of manner
which signified the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was,
strictly observed the invitation.She woke up and walked over to him.The window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from
where the two ladies sat, and although he was closer to the captain
Wentworth table, not very close.When she joined him, the captain
Harville's face took on a serious, thoughtful expression again.

“No,” Anna answered in a low, sensual voice.."What can I easily

"It was not in her nature.She's crazy about him."

"This would not be the case for any woman who truly loved."

Captain Harville smiled, as if to say, "You claim this is for your

sinking into the chair he occupied,
where he bent down and wrote, her eyes engulfed the next
the words:

Such a letter soon had to be taken from.Half an hour
loneliness and reflection could calm her down; but ten
only the minutes that now passed before she was interrupted, with all
restrains her position, can do nothing for peace of mind.Every moment brought fresh excitement.It was overwhelming
happiness.And before she went beyond the first stage complete
sensation, Charles, Mary and Henrietta all entered.The absolute need to appear as she herself produced then

left her in the quiet possession of that room, it would be her

distracting, and in despair she said she would go home.“By all means, my dear,” exclaimed Mrs Musgrove, “go straight home and

But a chair will never fit.Worst of all! To lose the opportunity
say a word to Captain Wentworth during her silence,
solo progress through the city (and she was almost sure that she would meet
him) could not bear.They objected fervently against the chair,
and Mrs Musgrove, who thought of only one kind of illness,
with some dismay, she assured herself that the fall in
a business; that Anne has never slipped off and got hit lately
on her head; that she was completely convinced that she did not fall;
can happily part with her and expect that she can do better
night.Eager not to miss any precautions, Anne resisted and said:

"I'm afraid, ma'am, it's not entirely clear.Pray like that

whole party tonight.I'm afraid there was some mistake; as well as
I wish you especially to assure Captain Harville and the Captain
Wentworth that we hope to see them both."

"Oh my dear, that is quite understandable, I give you my word.Captain
Harville thinks nothing but to leave."

"You think so? But I'm scared and I would be so sorry.Do you promise me to mention this when you see them again? You can

Harville anywhere, don't forget to relay a message to Miss Ann.But really,
my dear you don't need to worry.Captain Harville is holding on pretty

to tell."

Ann could do nothing more; but her heart prophesied some kind of accident to go out
the perfection of her happiness.However, this could not be very long..Even if he hadn't come to Camden Place himself, it would have been in her
the right to send an intelligible verdict to Captain Harville.Other
there was an instant irritation.Charles, genuinely concerned and kind
nature, will go home with her; there were no obstacles for him.It was
almost cruel.But she could not remain ungrateful for long; he donated
an engagement at a gunsmith to be of use to her; and she went
with him, without feeling, but with obvious gratitude.They were on Union Street when they fell behind faster, something like

which was pale now shone, and the movements that hesitated
were resolved.He walked beside her.Now struck by a sudden
thought, said Charles,

“Captain Wentworth, where are you going? Only on Gay Street or
further in the city? "

"I hardly know," Captain Wentworth replied in surprise..“Are you going to climb Belmont? Are you going near Camden Place?
Because if so, I won't hesitate to ask you to take mine

There could be no objections.There could only be the most suitable
liveliness, the most helpful conformity for public opinion; and smiles are held back
and the spirits dance in private delight.In half a minute Charles
was at the end of Union Street again, while the other two continued
together: and soon there were enough words between them to decide
their direction towards relatively quiet and secluded gravel
a walk where the power of conversation will make the real hour
a blessing indeed, and prepare it for all immortality that
the happiest memories of their future life could bestow.There
they again exchanged those feelings and promises that once
used to seem to provide everything, but this was followed by such
many, many years of separation and alienation.There they returned
back to the past, perhaps more exquisitely happy in their
reunion than when it was first planned; softer, more
tried, knew each other more firmly about character, truth and
the attachment; more equal, more justified in action.And there, how
they walked slowly along a gradual ascent, ignoring every group around
them, seeing neither the strolling politicians nor the fussy housekeepers,
flirting girls, as well as child maids and children, they could not afford
these retrospectives and confessions, especially in those
explanations of what immediately preceded the present moment, which
were so keen and so incessant in interest.Everything is small

today can hardly be the end.She was not wrong.Jealousy for Mr. Elliot was slowing down
weight, doubt, anguish.It began to act in the very
the hour of the first meeting with her in Bath; who came back after a short
suspension to spoil the concert; and it influenced him in
everything he said and did or did not say and did, in the last
twenty four hours.He gradually gave way to the best
hopes that her gaze, words, or actions sometimes encouraged; it
were finally defeated by those feelings and those tones that
reached him when she spoke to Captain Harville; and under
irresistible control, for which he grabbed a sheet of paper, and
poured out my feelings.From what he then wrote, nothing could be withdrawn or stipulated..He stubbornly loved no one but her.She never was
displaced.He didn't even believe that he would see her equal.In this way
in fact, he was forced to admit that he was a constant

and believed that it would be done.He imagined himself indifferent when
he was only angry; and he was unfair to her merits because
he suffered from them.Now her character was focused on him

began to understand myself.In Lyme he learned more
than one kind.A fleeting admiration for Mr. Elliot at least awakened
him, and scenes on Cobb and Captain Harville recorded her
superiority.In her previous attempts to join Louise Musgrove (
attempts of angry pride), he objected that he always felt
be impossible; that he didn't give a damn, didn't give a damn about Louise;
although until that day, until the leisure for reflection that followed
he did not understand the perfect perfection of the mind with which
Louise had such a bad reaction to the comparison, or the perfect unrivaled trick.

the stability of principle and the persistence of self-will, between
the little things of carelessness and the determination of collected thoughts.There
he saw everything to extol in his appreciation of the woman he had

his choice.From that time on, his repentance became harsh..He hasn't been before

After the accident with Louise, as soon as he felt alive again, he
began to feel, though alive, and not free.“I discovered,” he said, “that Harville thought I was an engaged man!
That neither Harville nor his wife doubted our common
the attachment.I was amazed and shocked.To some extent I could
immediately contradict it; but when I started to think about what others
could feel the same - her own family, no, perhaps she herself - I was
no longer at my own disposal.I was her honor if she wanted it..I was not guarded.I did not seriously think about this topic.

the danger of adverse consequences in many respects; and that I had no right to be

In short, he discovered too late that he was confused; and this
just when he was completely satisfied with not caring for Louise in
everything, he should consider himself connected with her, if her feelings for him
were what the Garvills envisioned.It made him leave Lime, and
wait for her complete recovery elsewhere.He will gladly weaken anyone

Ann smiled and let it go.It was too nice a mistake for

the youth; but the value of such reverence was inexpressibly increased to
Ann, comparing it to the old words and feeling that this

Their first meeting in Milsom Street gave many reasons for conversation, but
concert even more.This evening seemed to be made up of exquisite
moments.The moment she stepped forward in the octagonal room to
talk to him: at the moment Mr. Elliot appears and tears her
away, and one or two subsequent moments marked by the return of hope or
growing gloom, lived with energy.“To see you,” he exclaimed, “among those who could not be mine

and Mrs. Croft, all with special cordiality and ardent interest,

Wentworth, some communication happens all the time, and

she could flatter herself that she played a big role in
bond, leaving Anna with her in the fall; and like her own

that Captain Wentworth should be richer than any captain
