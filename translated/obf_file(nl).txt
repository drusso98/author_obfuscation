Chapter 1


Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who,
for his own amusement he never took up any other book but The Baronetage; Over there
he found occupation for an empty hour, and comfort in a distressed
a; there his faculties of admiration and respect were awakened by
reflect on the limited holdover of the earliest patents; there
unwelcome sensations, arising from internal affairs, changed naturally
pity and contempt as he turned the almost endless creations
of the last century; and there, when every other leaf was powerless, he
could read his own history with an interest that never failed.This
was the page where the favorite volume always opened:

           "ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married July 15, 1784, Elizabeth,
daughter of James Stevenson, Esq.from South Park, in the county
Gloucester, by which lady (died 1800) he has the issue Elizabeth, born
June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a stillborn son, November 5,
1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791."

Just as the paragraph had originally come from that of the printer
hands; but Sir Walter had corrected it by adding, for the information of:
himself and his family, these words, after Mary's date of birth -
"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove,
Esq.of Uppercross, in the County of Somerset, "and insert by most
exactly the day of the month in which he lost his wife.Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable
family, in the usual terms; how it first settled in Cheshire;
how called in Dugdale, in the service of the high sheriff's office,
to represent a municipality in three consecutive parliaments, efforts of
loyalty and dignity of baron, in the first year of Charles II, with
all the Marys and Elizabeths they were married to; a total of two shapes
handsome duodecimo pages, and ending with the arms and
motto: - "Headquarters, Kellynch Hall, County Somerset", ed
Sir Walter's handwriting again in this finale:--

Presumptive Heir, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great-grandson of the
second Sir Walter."

Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character;
vanity of person and situation.He had been remarkably handsome
his childhood; and at fifty-four he was still a very fine man.few women
could think more of their personal appearance than he, and he couldn't
the servant of a newly made gentleman would be more pleased with the place he occupied
in society.He considered the blessing of beauty only inferior to:
the blessing of a baron; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united
these gifts, were the constant object of his warmest respect and
dedication.His good looks and rank had a fair claim on his attachment; since
to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to anyone else
thing earned by its own.Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,
sensible and amiable; whose judgment and conduct, if they may be
never forgave the youthful infatuation that made her Lady Elliot ...
required pampering afterwards.- She had a mood, or softened, or
hid his shortcomings and promoted his true respect for
seventeen years; and though not the worst happiest creature in the world
herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends and her children,
to attach her to life, and not make it indifference to her
when she was called to leave them.--Three girls, the two oldest
sixteen and fourteen, was a terrible legacy for a mother to leave, a
terrible accusation rather, to rely on the authority and guidance of one
cocky, stupid father.However, she had a very intimate friend, a...
sensible, deserving woman, who was brought, by strong attachment
for themselves, to settle close to her, in the village of Kellynch; and further
Her kindness and advice trusted Lady Elliot mainly for the best help
and upholding the good principles and instructions she had
anxious about giving her daughters.This friend, and Sir Walter, are not married, whatever may have been
expect on that head by their knowledge.Thirteen years old
died since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still close
neighbors and close friends, and one remained a widower, the other
a widow.That Lady Russell, of solid age and character, and exceedingly good
foreseen, should not think of a second marriage, has no
apologies to the public, which tends to be unreasonable
dissatisfied if a woman marries again than if she does not; but
Sir Walter's progress in singleness requires explanation.It she
then I knew that Sir Walter, like a good father, (had met a
or two private disappointments in very unreasonable uses),
prided himself on staying single because of his lovely daughters.In front of
a daughter, his eldest, he would have really given up everything,
which he hadn't been very tempted to do.Elizabeth had
passed all that was possible, at the age of sixteen, of her mother's rights
and consequence; and be very handsome, and very much like himself, her
the influence had always been great, and they had gone together the most
happy.His other two children were of very inferior value.Mary had
got a little artificial interest, by becoming Mrs. Charles
Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of
character, which must have placed her high among all people of real
understanding, nobody was with father or sister; her word was no
weight, her ease was always to admit - she was only Anne.To Lady Russell she was indeed a very dear and much esteemed
goddaughter, favorite and friend.Lady Russell loved them all; but
only with Anne could she imagine that the mother would revive.A few years earlier, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her ...
bloom had disappeared early; and as even in his height, her father had
found little to admire in her, (so completely different were her delicate
features and mild dark eyes of its own), there could be nothing in it
them, now that she was faded and thin, to arouse his esteem.He had
never conceded much hope, he had none now, to ever read her name
every other page of his favorite work.All equality of alliance must
rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had only bonded with an old...
country family of respectability and a great fortune, and therefore had
all credit given and none received: Elizabeth would, one day or so
different, appropriate marriage.It sometimes happens that at the age of twenty-nine a woman is prettier than she is
was ten years earlier; and, in general, if there
neither ill health nor fear, it is a time of life when hardly
every charm is lost.It was like that with Elizabeth, still the same pretty
Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter
could therefore be excused by forgetting, or at least being, her age
considered only half a fool, as he considered himself and Elizabeth thriving
as always, amid the wreckage of everyone else's good looks; for him
could clearly see how old the rest of his family and acquaintances were?
grew.Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face in the
neighborhood sausage, and the rapid increase in crow's feet over
Lady Russell's temples had distressed him for a long time.Elizabeth did not quite match her father in personal satisfaction.For thirteen years her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and
directing with a self-control and decision that never could have been
given the idea that she was younger than she was.For thirteen years
she had done the honor and enacted the national law by
home, and the road leads to the chaise and four, and on foot
immediately after Lady Russell from all salons and
dining halls in the countryside.Thirteen winters' spinning frost had
saw her open every ball of credit that was a scant neighborhood
commandments, and thirteen wells showed their blossoms as she traveled
to London with her father, to enjoy the
great world.She remembered all this, she had the
realization of being twenty-nine to give her some regret and
some concerns; she was completely satisfied that she was still like this
pretty as ever, but she felt herself approaching the years of danger, and
would have been happy to make sure to have been asked correctly by
baronet blood within the next twelve months or two.Maybe she would do it again
taking up the book of books with as much pleasure as in her early youth,
but now she didn't like it.Always to get the date from her
own birth and see no marriage but that of a youngest sister,
made the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it
open on the table next to her, she had closed it with averted eyes, and ...
pushed it away.She had, incidentally, been disappointed with that book, and especially
the history of her own family, must ever be remembered.The heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., whose
rights was so generously supported by her father, was disappointed
her.When she was a very young girl, as soon as she knew he was
in case she didn't have a brother, the future baron meant
marry him, and her daddy always meant she should.He didn't have
known to them as a boy; but shortly after the death of Lady Elliot, sir
Walter had sought the knowledge, and though his advances hadn't
had received every warmth, he had persisted in seeking it, making it
allowance for the modest withdrawal of the youth; and, in one of their
spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom, Mr.
Elliot was forced to release.He was a very young man at the time, just studying the
law; and Elizabeth found him exceedingly pleasant, and every plan in his
favor was confirmed.He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked
from and expected for the rest of the year; but he never came.The
next spring he was seen again in the city, found equally pleasant,
again encouraged, invited and expected, and again he did not come; and
the next news was that he was married.Instead of pushing his
fortune in the line plotted for the heir to the house of Elliot, he,
had gained independence by uniting herself with a rich woman of
inferior birth.Sir Walter would have hated it.As head of the house, he felt that he was
should have been consulted, especially after taking the young man like that
publicly on hand; "Because they must have been seen together," he said
noted, "once at Tattersall's, and twice in the lobby of the House of
Commons."His disapproval was expressed, but apparently very little"
considered.Mr. Elliot had made no attempt to apologize and presented himself as ...
Unsolicited longer to be noticed by the family, like Sir Walter
thought it unworthy of him: had all knowledge between them
held up.This very uncomfortable history of Mr. Elliot was still, after a break of
years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who liked the man for a while
herself, and even more so because he was her father's heir, and whose mighty one
family pride only saw in him a good match for Sir Walter
Elliot's eldest daughter.There wasn't a baron from A to Z who had them
feelings so desperately could have been recognized as an equal.Yet
he had behaved miserably, although she was right now
time (summer of 1814) wore black ribbons for his wife, she could
don't admit he's worth thinking about again.The shame of his first
marriage perhaps, as there was no reason to accept it
perpetuated by descendants, have been conquered, had he not fared worse;
but he had, as by the usual intercession of friendly friends, she
was informed, most disrespectfully spoken of all, most
contemptuous and contemptuous of the blood to which he belonged, and
the honor that would be his after this.This couldn't be
forgiveness.Those were Elizabeth Elliot's feelings and sensations; so the concerns
alloy, the agitations to vary, the equality and the elegance, the
prosperity and the nothingness of her life scene; like the feelings
to arouse interest in a long, peaceful stay in a rural circle,
to fill the vacancies where customs were not useful abroad, no
talents or achievements to occupy at home.But now another occupation and concern of the mind began to arise begon
added to this.Her father started to worry more and more about money.They
knew that when he took up the Baronetage now, it was at the
heavy bills from his merchants, and Mr .'s unwanted hints
Shepherd, his agent, from his mind.Kellynch's property was
good, but not equivalent to Sir Walter's state arrest
in its owner.While Lady Elliot lived there had been a method,
moderation and thrift, which had just kept him within his income; but
with her such righteousness had already died, and from that time he was
had consistently surpassed it.He hadn't managed to
spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was ...
compelling to do; but no matter how impeccable he was, he was not alone
grew terribly in debt, but heard about it so often that it ...
became in vain to hide it any longer, even partially, from his
daughter.He'd given her a few hints of it last spring in town;
he had even gone so far as to say, 'Can we cut back? It happens
you know that there is an article in which we can cut back? "and
Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first zeal of women's alarm,
seriously to think about what could be done, and eventually suggested
these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities,
and to refrain from redesigning the salon; to which
aids she later added with the happy thought that they were taking no
to give to Anne, as had been the usual annual custom.But this
measures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real
magnitude of evil, of which Sir Walter felt obliged
to confess to her shortly afterwards.Elizabeth had nothing to propose
deeper efficacy.She felt ill-used and unhappy, just like her
father; and neither of them was able to devise a way to
reduce their spending without compromising their dignity, or
relinquish their comfort in a way not to be carried.There was only a small portion of his estate available to Sir Walter
from; but if every acre had been alienable, it would have yielded none
difference.He had condescended to a mortgage as far as he had it
power, but he would never deign to sell.No; he never would
disgraced his name so far.The Kellynch estate is to be transferred
whole and whole, as he had received it.Their two confidential friends, Mr. Shepherd, who are in the
neighboring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them;
and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be
beaten by one or the other to allay their embarrassment and
reduce their expenses, without losing any indulgence
of taste or pride.Chapter 2


Mr. Shepherd, a cultured, prudent lawyer, who, whatever his grasp may be
or his opinion of Sir Walter, would rather have the unpleasant impression
by someone else, apologized for giving the slightest hint, and
only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent
judgment of Lady Russell, of whose well-known common sense he fully
expects he would get exactly such resolute measures as he intended to see
finally accepted.Lady Russell was very diligent on the subject and gave it
lots of serious consideration.She was more of a woman of health than of...
fast capabilities, of which it is difficult to come to a decision
example were great, because of the contradiction of two guiding principles.She herself was of strict integrity, with a delicate sense of honor;
but she wanted to save Sir Walter's feelings as much as she was concerned
for the honor of the family, as aristocratic in its ideas of what was
thanks to them, as anyone could be with feeling and honesty.she was a
benevolent, charitable, good woman and capable of strong attachments,
most correct in her behavior, strict in her notions of decorum, and with
manners that were considered a standard of good breeding.She had a
cultured mind, and was, generally speaking, rational and consistent;
but she had prejudices on the part of her lineage; she had value for it
rank and consequence, which blinded her a little from its mistakes
who owned them?.Even the widow of just a knight, she gave the
dignity of a baron is all due to her; and Sir Walter, independent of it
pretends to be an old acquaintance, a considerate neighbor, a obliging
landlord, husband of her very dear friend, father of Anne and vader
her sisters, like Sir Walter, was entitled to it in her fear
much compassion and attention under his current
difficulties.They have to cut back; that gave no doubt.But she was bad
afraid to have it done with as little pain as possible for him and
Elizabeth.She made economic plans, she made exact calculations,
and she did what no one else thought of: she consulted Anne, who
was never regarded by the others as having an interest in the
ask.She consulted, and was to some extent influenced by her in
delineating the austerity schedule that was ultimately submitted to
Sir Walter.Any improvement from Anne's was on the side of honesty
against importance.She wanted stronger measures, a more complete
reform, faster debt cancellation, a much higher tone of it
indifference to everything but justice and equality.'If we can persuade your father to do all this,' said Lady Russell,
looking over her paper, 'much can still be done.If he takes it over
regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope we can
to convince him and Elizabeth that Kellynch Hall has a respectability
which cannot in themselves be affected by these reductions; and that the
true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be far from diminished in the
eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.What shall
in fact, he is only doing what many of our first families have
done, or should do? There will be nothing special in his case; and
it is the singularity that often makes the worst of our suffering, like
it always matters from our behavior.I have great hope to be victorious.We
must be serious and determined; for the person who has it
they have to pay debts incurred; and although much is due to the
feelings of the lord, and head of a house, like your father,
there is even more thanks to the character of an honest man."

This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be
continuing, his friends insist upon him.She considered it an act
indispensable duty to protect the claims of creditors with all
the expedition that could secure the most extensive cuts,
and saw no dignity in anything less.She wanted it to be that way
prescribed, and felt like a duty.She assessed the influence of Lady Russell
very; and as to the serious degree of self-denial she possesses
had known, she believed that perhaps there would be little more trouble
to convince them to a full, then a half reformation.Her
knowledge of her father and Elizabeth made her think that the
the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of
both, and so on, through the whole list of Lady Russell's too gentle
reductions.How Anne's more rigid claims would have been assumed is of little importance
consequence.Lady Russell's was not successful at all: could not be hanged
with, were not bearable."What! All the comforts of life fell off!
Travel, London, servants, horses, table - labor pains and
restrictions everywhere! To no longer live with the decades, not even of
a private gentleman! No, he'd rather leave Kellynch Hall right away,
than to stay in it on such shameful terms."

“Quit Kellynch Hall."The hint was immediately taken over by Mr
Shepherd, whose interest was concerned with Sir Walter's reality
austerity, and who was utterly convinced that nothing would be done
without a change of residence."Since the idea was started in the
on the point that should dictate, he had no qualms," he said, "in
confessing that his judgment is entirely on that side.It didn't
seems to him that Sir Walter can fundamentally change his style
living in a house that had such a welcoming and ancient character
dignity to support.In any other place Sir Walter could judge...
himself; and would be looked up to, as regulating the ways of life in
whatever way he would choose to model his household."

Sir Walter would leave Kellynch Hall; and after a few days more
doubt and indecision, the big question of where to go was ...
arranged, and the first sketches of this important change were made.There would have been three alternatives: London, Bath or some other house in...
the country.All Anne's wishes had been for the last.A small house
in their own neighborhood, where they may still have Lady Russell's
society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure of sometimes
seeing the lawns and bushes of Kellynch was her goal
ambition.But Anne's usual fate came to her, by having something
quite opposite to her tendency fixated on.She hated Bath, and
didn't think it agreed with her; and Bath would be her home.Sir Walter had thought more of London at first; but Mr. Shepherd felt
that he could not be trusted in London and had been skilled enough to...
deter him from it, and make Bath preferred.It was much safer
place for a gentleman in his predicament: he can be important there
at a relatively low cost.Two material advantages of Bath over
London, of course, had already gained their weight: it's more convenient
away from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and the expenditure of Lady Russell
part of every winter there; and to the great satisfaction of
Lady Russell, whose first opinion had been on the planned change
Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were led to believe that they should
lose neither effect nor pleasure by settling there.Lady Russell felt obliged to resist the wishes of her dear Anne.It
would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in
his own neighborhood.Anne herself would be the
mortifications of it more than she had foreseen, and to Sir Walter's
feelings they must have been terrible.And with regard to Anne's
aversion to Bath, she regarded it as a prejudice and error that arose,
first, because of the fact that she spent three years in school
there, after her mother's death; and second, because it is accidental
not quite cheerful the only winter she had afterwards
spent there with himself.In short, Lady Russell loved Bath and was inclined to think she had to
suitable for all; and as for the health of her young friend, by all
warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge, any danger would be avoided;
and it was, in fact, a change that both health and mind must make
good.Anne had been away from home too little, seen too little.her mind
were not high.A bigger society would improve them.She wanted her to
to be more famous.The undesirability of another house in the same neighborhood for
Sir Walter was certainly greatly strengthened in part, and a very ...
material part of the scheme, which was gladly grafted onto the
get started.He would not only leave his house, but also see it in the…
hands of others; a test of steadfastness stronger than Sir
Walter has found too much.Kellynch Hall would be rented out.This,
was, however, a deep secret, which could not be breathed outside of theirs
circle.Sir Walter could not have endured the humiliation of his fame
design rent out his house.Mr. Shepherd had once mentioned the floor
"advertising", but never dared to approach it again.Sir Walter turned it down
idea that it is offered in any way; forbade the slightest hint
dropped because he has such an intention; and it was only on the
assumption that he was spontaneously asked by some
unspeakable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,
that he would let it at all.How quickly came the reasons for approving what we like! Lady Russell
had another excellent one on hand, as he was extremely happy that mister
Walter and his family would expel the country.Elizabeth had
lately formed an intimacy, which she wanted to see interrupted.It was with Mr Shepherd's daughter, who had returned from a...
not a prosperous marriage, with her father's house, with the extra
burden of two children.She was a smart young woman who understood
the art of pleasing - the art of pleasing, at least, at Kellynch Hall;
and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot, as if she were
I stayed there more than once, despite all that Lady
Russell, who felt it was an out of place friendship, might hint at:
caution and reserve.Indeed, Lady Russell had little influence over Elizabeth, and...
seemed to love her, more because she would love her than because ...
Elizabeth deserved it.She had never received more from her than...
outward attention, nothing but the observance of complacency; had
never succeeded at a point she wanted to wear, against
previous tendency.She had repeatedly been very serious in her efforts
to involve Anne in the visit to London, be sensibly open to all
injustice and all the discrediting of the selfish arrangements that the
her out, and on far lesser occasions had tried to give Elizabeth
the benefit of its own better judgment and experience; but always inside
vain: Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she pursued it
more outspoken opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs
Clay; turning away from the society of such a deserving sister, in order to bestow her
affection and trust in someone who should have been nothing to her
but the object of distant politeness.Given the situation, Mrs. Clay was, in Lady Russell's estimation, a very
wrong, and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;
and a move that would leave Mrs. Clay, bringing a choice of ...
more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot's reach, was therefore a
object of first-class importance.Chapter 3


"I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter," said Mr Shepherd
morning at Kellynch Hall, putting down the paper, "that the...
the present moment is much in our favor.This peace will change everything
our rich naval officers ashore.They all want a home.There couldn't be a better time, Sir Walter, to have a choice of tenants,
very responsible tenants.Much noble fortune has been made during
the war.If a rich admiral should come our way, Sir Walter..."

'He would be a very happy man, Shepherd,' Sir Walter replied; "that is
all i need to notice.A prize would indeed be Kellynch Hall for him;
rather the greatest prize of all, let him ever take so many
before; Hey, Shepherd?"

Mr. Shepherd laughed, as he knew he had to, at this wit, then added:

'I take it, Sir Walter, that, from a business point of view, I
navy gentlemen are good to deal with.I've had a little
knowledge of their way of doing business; and I am free to confess
that they have, and probably will make, very liberal views
desired tenants as any group of people one should meet meets.Therefore, Sir Walter, I should like to propose by leave that if dat
as a result of rumors about your intention abroad; which
should be considered as a possible thing, because we know how difficult
it is to take the actions and designs of a part of the world out of the
attentiveness and curiosity about the other; consequence is his tax; Me, John
Shepherd, could not hide from anyone family matters that I have chosen
would find it worthwhile to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot
has eyes on him that are very difficult to avoid; and
that is why I venture so much into it that it will not be very surprising
me if, with all our caution, would get a rumor of the truth ...
Abroad; in the assumption of which, as I came to note, since
applications will no doubt follow, I would think of ours
wealthy naval commanders who are especially worth seeing; and beg for leave
to add, that two hours will bring me anytime, to give you the
struggling to answer."

Sir Walter just nodded.But soon after, get up and pace
room, he remarked sarcastically ...

“There are few of the Navy gentlemen, I think, who would
don't be surprised that they are in a house of this description."

"They would no doubt look around and bless their happiness,"
said Mrs. Clay, for Mrs. Clay was there: her father had ridden her...
over, nothing is more beneficial to Mrs. Clay's health than a ride to ...
Kellynch: “But I totally agree with my dad that a sailor could
being a highly desirable tenant.I know a lot of the
profession; and apart from their generosity, they are so neat and careful
in all their ways! These precious photos of you, Sir Walter, as...
you chose to leave them would be completely safe.Everything in and
about the house would be so well taken care of! The gardens and
shrubs would be kept in almost as high a condition as they are now.YOU
Don't worry, Miss Elliot, that your own sweet flower gardens are ...
neglected."

“About all that,” Sir Walter replied coolly, “assuming I was tempted
to rent out my house, I have not yet decided on the
privileges to be attached to it.I'm not particularly inclined
favor a tenant.The park would of course be open to him, and to little navy
officers, or men of different description, may have had such a range;
but what restrictions could I place on the use of the
pleasure grounds, is another thing.I am not fond of the idea of ​​mine
shrubs always approachable; and I should recommend Miss
Elliot to be wary of her flower garden.I am very
little inclined to give a tenant of Kellynch Hall something out of the ordinary
favour, I assure you, whether he be a sailor or a soldier."

After a short pause, Mr. Shepherd presumably took to say:

"In all these cases there are fixed customs that make everything alles
clear and easy between landlord and tenant.Your interest, Mr. Walter,
is in reasonably safe hands.Trust me to make sure no tenant
has more than his righteous rights.I dare point out that Sir Walter
Elliot can't be half as jealous of his as John Shepherd will be
for him."

Here spoke Anne--

"The Navy, I think, which has done so much for us, at least has one
equal claim with any other set of men, for all conveniences and all
privileges that every house can give.Sailors work hard enough for them
comfort, we must all allow it."

"Very true, very true.What Miss Anne says is very true, ”Mr.
Shepherd's reply, and "Oh, sure," was his daughter's; but Sir
Walter's comment was, shortly afterwards:

'The profession has its uses, but I should be sorry to see one
friend of mine who belongs."

"Indeed!" was the answer, and with a surprised look."Yes; it is offensive to me on two counts; I have two strong grounds for it
objection against.First, as being the means of making persons of
obscure birth to excessive discernment, and raising people to honor who
their fathers and grandfathers had never dreamed of it; and second, as it
horribly cuts a man's youth and strength to pieces; a sailor gets old
sooner than any other man.I've observed it all my life.A man is
in greater danger in the Navy of being offended by the emergence of one
whose father would have despised his father to contradict, and from
become an object of loathing itself prematurely, than in any other
line.Last spring I was in town one day in the company of two men,
striking examples of what I'm talking about; Lord St Ives, whose father?
we all know we have been a pastor without bread to eat; I was
giving way to Lord St Ives, and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most ...
deplorable looking character you can imagine; his face the color of
mahogany, rough and robust to the last degree; all the lines and wrinkles,
nine gray hairs on one side, and nothing but a dab of powder on the top.'In
the name of heaven, who is that old fellow?' I said to a friend of mine
who stood nearby, (Sir Basil Morley).'Old fellow!' sir called out
Basil, 'it's Admiral Baldwin'.What do you think his age is?'
'Sixty,' I said, 'or maybe sixty-two'.``Forty,'' replied Sir Basil,
'forty, and no more.'Imagine my surprise; I will not
easily forget Admiral Baldwin.I've never seen such a miserable one
example of what a seafaring life can do; but to some extent I know it is
the same goes for all of them: they are all pushed over and exposed to…
any climate and any weather, until they are not fit to be seen.It
it's a shame they don't get hit on the head right away, before they reach
The Age of Admiral Baldwin."

“No, Sir Walter,” Mrs. Clay called out, “this is serious indeed.To have
a little pity for the poor men.We're not all born to be pretty.The sea is certainly not more beautiful; sailors grow old prematurely; I
have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.But that's not it
same with many other professions, maybe most others? Soldiers,
on active duty are no better off at all: and even in the quieter ones
professions, there is a toil and a labor of the mind, if not of the
body, which rarely leaves a man's appearance to the natural effect of time.The lawyer struggles, quite carelessly; the doctor is awake at all times,
and travel in all weather conditions; and even the preacher-- "she stopped a
moment to consider what could do for the pastor; - "and even the
Pastor, you know it is obligatory to enter and expose contaminated rooms

actually, as I have long been convinced, although any profession is
necessary and honorable in turn, it is only the fate of those who
are not obliged to follow someone who can live in a regular way, in the
country, choose their own hours, monitor their own activities, and
live on their own property, without the torment of trying more;
it is their lot alone, I say, to maintain the blessings of health and good
appearance to the extreme: I know no other set of men than to lose some
some of their personality when they stop being quite young."

It seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this fear, spoke of Sir Walter
good will to a naval officer as a tenant, was endowed with
foresight; because the very first application for the house was from a
Admiral Croft, with whom he joined shortly afterwards
attending the quartz sessions in Taunton; and indeed he had received
a hint from the admiral of a London correspondent.Because of the report that
he rushed to Kellynch to make, Admiral Croft was a resident of
Somersetshire, who had made a very fine fortune, wished
to settle in his own country, and had come to Taunton to do so
look at some advertised places in that immediate area which,
however, did not suit him; hearing that by accident--(it was just like...
he had predicted, Mr Shepherd remarked, that Sir Walter's concerns could not
be kept secret,) - accidentally hearing the possibility of
Kellynch Hall is available for rent and understands (Mr Shepherd's)
connection with the owner, he had introduced himself to him
do some special research, and that had happened over quite a long time
conference, expressed as a strong tendency for the place as a man
who knew it only by description could feel it; and given Mr Shepherd, in
his explicit account of himself, any proof that he is the most
responsible eligible tenant."And who is Admiral Croft?" was Sir Walter's cold, suspicious investigation.Mr Shepherd replied because he belonged to a gentleman's family, and
named a place; and Anne, after the short break that followed,
added--

"He's a Vice Admiral to the Whites".He was in the Trafalgar action,
and has been in the East Indies ever since; he was stationed there, I
believe, several years."

"Then I take it for granted," remarked Sir Walter, "that his face...
about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery."

Mr. Shepherd rushed to assure him that Admiral Croft was a very good person,
affectionate, handsome man, a little weathered, to be sure, but not
many, and all the lord in all his views and conduct; not
probably the smallest difficulty on terms making, just wanted a
comfortable house, and to get into it as soon as possible; knew he had to
pay for its convenience; knew what a ready furnished house rents from it
could have effect; shouldn't have been surprised if Sir Walter
had asked for more; had inquired about the mansion; would be happy with the
deputation, sure, but didn't make a big deal of it; he said sometimes
picked up a gun, but never killed; quite sir.Mr. Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; noting all
circumstances of the admiral's family that made him special
desirable as a tenant.He was a married man, and without children; the
very much to be desired.A home has never been properly looked after, sir
Shepherd remarked, without a lady: he did not know if furniture
perhaps not so much in danger of suffering if there were no lady, if
where there were many children.A lady, without family, was the most
best furniture keeper in the world.He had seen Mrs Croft too;
she was in Taunton with the admiral and had been there most of the time
the time they discussed the matter."And a very eloquent, dignified, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,"
he continued; asked more questions about the house, and the conditions, and
taxes, than the admiral himself, and seemed to be more familiar with them
company; and besides, Sir Walter, I thought she wasn't quite ...
not connected in this country, any more than her husband; It is to say,
she is the sister of a gentleman who once dwelt among us; she told me
so herself: sister of the gentleman who lived in a few years ago
Monkford.Bless me! what was his name? At the moment I cannot
remember his name, although I've heard it that way lately.Penelope, my
dear, can you help me with the name of the gentleman who attended
Monkford: Mrs Croft's brother? '

But Mrs. Clay talked so eagerly to Miss Elliot that she didn't ...
hear the appeal.“I have no idea who you can mean, Herder; I remember no
Lord resident in Monkford since the time of the old Governor Trent."

"Bless me! How very strange! I shall soon forget my own name, I suppose.A name I know so well; knew the gentleman so
good on sight; have seen him a hundred times; came to consult me ​​once, me
remember, about a transgression of one of his neighbors; farmer
break into his orchard; wall broken down; stolen apples; caught in the
fact; and then, contrary to my judgment, subject to one
amicable compromise.Very strange indeed! "

After waiting another moment...

"You mean Mr. Wentworth, I suppose?" said Anne.Mr. Shepherd was all gratitude.'Wentworth was the real name! Mr Wentworth was the real man.He had
the curation of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time ago, for two
or three years.Came there around the year --- 5, I take it.YOU
remember him i'm sure."

"Wentworth? Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the chaplain of Monkford.you misled
me by the term lord.I thought you were talking about a man
property: Mr. Wentworth was nobody, I remember; quite separate from each other;
nothing to do with the Strafford family.You wonder how the names of
many of our nobility become so common."

Since Mr. Shepherd noticed that this connection from the Crofts didn't affect them
service with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; return, with all
his zeal, to dwell more indisputably on the circumstances in them
favor; their age and number and fortune; the lofty idea they had
formed from Kellynch Hall, and extreme concern for the benefit of
renting out; making it seem like they didn't rank anything other than the
Lucky to be Sir Walter Elliot's Tenants: An Extraordinary
taste, sure, they could have been supposed to be in the secret of Sir
Walter's estimate of a tenant's dues.However, it succeeded; and although Sir Walter must ever look with one
evil eye on anyone who intends to inhabit that house, and think they
infinitely too good to rent it at the highest
terms, he was persuaded to allow Mr Shepherd to continue in the
treaty, and authorize him to wait for Admiral Croft, who is still...
stayed in Taunton, and set a day for the house to be seen.Sir Walter was not very wise; yet he had enough experience of the
world, that a more impeccable tenant, in all essentials,
than Admiral Croft had honestly said could hardly offer.So far went to be
understanding; and his vanity made for a little extra soothing, in
the situation of the admiral in life, which was just high enough, and not
too high.'I have rented my house to Admiral Croft', would sound
extremely good; a lot better than a regular Mr--; a mister (save,
maybe half a dozen in the nation,) always needs a note of
explanation.An admiral pronounces his own retinue, and at the same time ...
time, can never make a Baron look small.In all their actions and
intercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever take precedence.Nothing can be done without a reference to Elizabeth: but her

Red cheeks; and as she walked past a favorite forest, said, with a
soft sigh: 'A few more months and maybe he'll walk here."



Chapter 4


He was not, however, Mr Wentworth, the former parish priest of Monkford
suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth, his
brother, who was appointed commander as a result of the action at St
Domingo, and not immediately enlisted, had come to Somersetshire
the summer of 1806; and without having a parent, found half a house
a year at Monkford.He was a remarkably fine young man at the time,
with great intelligence, mind and genius; and Anne an
extremely beautiful girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste and feeling.Maybe half the pull, on either side, was enough
he had nothing to do and she had hardly anyone to love; but the
meeting of such exuberant recommendations could not fail.They were
got to know each other gradually, and when they got to know each other, quickly and deeply in love.It would be difficult to say which one had seen the highest perfection in the
other, or who had been happiest: she, in receiving his
statements and proposals, or by allowing them to be accepted.A short period of fine happiness followed, and only a short one.Problems soon arose.Sir Walter, on his request, without actually
Withholding his consent, or saying it never should be, gave it all
negative of great surprise, great coldness, great silence, and a
declared his determination not to do anything for his daughter.He thought so
a very humiliating alliance; and Lady Russell, albeit with more temperament
and pride in vain, it received as a very unfortunate one.Anne Elliot, with all her claims to birth, beauty and spirit, to overthrow
himself away at nineteen; getting involved in an engagement at nineteen
with a young man who had nothing but himself to recommend him, and no...
hope to achieve prosperity, but in the chances of a very uncertain
profession, and no connections to even his further rise in the
profession, would indeed be a throw away, which she mourned
think about! Anne Elliot, so young; known to so few, to be snatched away
by a stranger with no alliance or fortune; or rather sunk by him in a
state of the most weight-bearing, fearful, juvenile dependence! It's not allowed
are, if by any honest interference of friendship, any representation of
someone who almost had maternal love and maternal rights it would be
prevented.Captain Wentworth had no fortune.He had been lucky in his profession;
but freely publishing what had become free had accomplished nothing.But
he was convinced that he would soon be rich: full of life and zeal,
he knowed that soon he would have a ship, and soon be at a station that ...
would lead to everything he wanted.He had always been lucky; he knew
he should be so quiet.Such confidence, strong in its own warmth,
and enchanting in the humor it often expressed must have been
enough for Anne; but Lady Russell saw it very differently.To be
an optimistic character and a fearless spirit worked very differently
her.She saw only a worsening of evil in it.It only has one
dangerous character to himself.He was brilliant, he was wayward.Lady Russell had little taste for humor and for anything near...
carelessness an abomination.She despised the connection in every light.The opposition these feelings aroused was more than Anne could handle
fight.Young and gentle as she was, it might still have been possible
to resist her father's ill will, though not softened by a kind word
or look from her sister's side; but Lady Russell who had them
always loved and trusted, couldn't, with such steadfastness of mind,
and such a tender manner, advise her constantly in vain.She was persuaded to believe that the engagement was a wrong thing: indiscreet,
inappropriate, barely capable of success, and does not deserve it.But it was
not a mere selfish warning, under which she acted, to end
to it.Hadn't she imagined consulting his good, even more?
than her own, she could hardly have given him up.The belief of being
cautious and self-denying, mainly to his advantage, was her most important
comfort, under the misery of a parting, a last parting; and every
comfort was required, for she had to face everything else
pain of opinions, on his side, totally unconvinced and inflexible, and
of his feeling that he was feeling sick by being so forced to give up.He had
leaving the country as a result.A few months had seen the beginning and end of their acquaintance;
but not in a few months Anne's share of suffering ended eindigde.Her
attachment and regret had clouded any pleasure for a long time
childhood, and an early loss of bloom and booze had been their lasting feelings
effect.More than seven years have passed since this little history of sad
the interest had come to an end; and the time had softened much,
perhaps almost all of them had a peculiar attachment to him, but so was she
depending on time alone; no assistance had been given if there was a change of location
(except on one visit to Bath shortly after the breakup), or in a novelty
or expansion of society.No one had ever entered the Kellynch
circle, who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth, since he
was in her memory.No second attachment, the only thorough one
natural, happy, and sufficient healing in her time of life
possibly because of the nice tone of her mind, the fastidiousness of her taste,
in the small confines of the society around them.She was
asked, when she was about twenty-two, to change her name, by the young ones
husband, who soon after found a more willing spirit in her younger
sister; and Lady Russell had regretted her refusal; for Charles Musgrove
was the eldest son of a man whose land and general
importance in that country were second to that of Sir Walter, and van
good character and appearance; and however Lady Russell might have it
had asked for anything more, while Anne was nineteen, she would have done it
delighted to see her at twenty-two, so respectfully removed from the ...
partialities and iniquities of her father's house, and so settled
permanently close to himself.But in this case, Anne had left nothing for it
advice to do; and though Lady Russell, as pleased as ever with her
at her discretion, never wished the past to be undone, she now started the
fear that borders on hopelessness because some tempt Anne
man of talent and independence, to enter a state she loved
that she is particularly suited to her warm affection and domestic habits gewoon.They knew not each other's opinion, neither its steadfastness, nor its change,
on the sole guiding point of Anne's behavior, for the subject was never ...
alluded to; but Anne, twenty-seven, thought quite differently
of what she should have thought at nineteen.She didn't blame
Lady Russell, she didn't blame herself for allowing her to lead her;
but she felt that was any young person in similar circumstances omstandigheden
ask her for advice, they would never get anything like this
immediate misery, such an uncertain future good.She was convinced
that under every drawback of censure at home, and every
fear at his occupation, all their probable fears, delays, and
disappointments, she should have been a happier woman in
to keep the betrothal than she had been in offering it;
and this, she fully believed, had the usual share, even more than
the usual part of all this worry and tension was theirs,
without reference to the actual results of their case, which, as it is
happened, would have prospered rather than could have been
reasonably calculated on.All his optimistic expectations, all are
confidence was justified.His brilliance and enthusiasm had seemed
to foresee and command his prosperous path.He had it very shortly afterwards

have made a handsome fortune.She only had navy lists and newspapers
for her authority, but she could not doubt that he was rich; and in
Because of his steadfastness, she had no reason to believe he was married.How eloquent Anne Elliot could have been! how eloquent were at least
her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerfulness
confidence in the future, against that overprotective caution it seems

prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older: the
natural continuation of an unnatural beginning.With all these circumstances, memories and feelings, she couldn't
learn that Captain Wentworth's sister would probably live in Kellynch
without a revival of past pain; and many a walk, and many a sigh,
were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea?.She often said:
it was folly herself, before she could harden her nerves sufficiently
to keep up with the ongoing discussion about the Crofts and their company no. to feel
disaster.However, she was assisted by that perfect indifference and
apparent unconsciousness, among the only three of her own friends

in this, about that of her father and Elizabeth; she could honor everything

among them was very important from whatever it sprang; and in the
When Admiral Croft really takes Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced again
about the conviction that had always been very grateful to her, of the
past known to those three only among her relatives, by whom no
syllable, she believed, would ever be whispered, and in confidence that
among his had only the brother with whom he had lived,
received some information about their short-lived engagement.That brother
had long been removed from the land and was a wise man, and,
besides, she was a single man at the time, she was fond of no
a human being heard about it from him.The sister, Mrs. Croft, had then been from England and accompanied her
husband on a foreign channel, and her own sister, Mary, had been
school while it all happened; and never admitted by the pride of some,
and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards.With this support she hoped that the acquaintance between herself haar
and the Crofts, who, with Lady Russell, still residing in Kellynch,
and Mary is only three miles away, should be expected, need not...
involve a certain clumsiness.chapter 5


Appointed in the morning for Admiral and Mrs Croft to see Kellynch
Hall, Anne found it very natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady
Russell's, and stay out of the way until it's all over; when she found it
very normal to regret that she missed the chance to see
them.This meeting of the two parties turned out to be very satisfactory and decided
the whole company at once.Every lady used to be good for
an agreement, and therefore saw nothing but good manners in the
Others; and with regard to the gentlemen, there was such a hearty good
humor, such an open, trusting generosity on the side of the admiral, as ...
could not help but influence Sir Walter, who had also felt flattered ...
his very best and most polished demeanor according to Mr Shepherd's assurances
of being known, by report, to the admiral, as an example of good
to breed.The house and grounds and furnishings were approved, the Crofts were ...
approved, conditions, time, everything and every body was right; and mr
Shepherd's clerks were put to work, without a single one being there
temporary difference to change everything that "This contract proves."

Sir Walter stated without hesitation that the admiral de
best looking sailor he had ever met, going so far as to say:
that if his own husband had had his hair tidy, he should
don't be ashamed to be seen with him somewhere; and the admiral, with
sympathetic cordiality, noted to his wife as they drove back
the park, 'I thought we should make a deal quickly, my dear, despite
from what they told us in Taunton.The Baronet will never set the Thames
on fire, but there doesn't seem to be any harm in him."- mutual
compliments, which would have been deemed approximately equal.The Crofts are said to have property on Michaelmas; and like Sir Walter
proposed to move to Bath there during the course of the previous month
there was no time to lose in making each dependent arrangement.Lady Russell, convinced that Anne should not belong to anyone
use, or any interest, in choosing the house they were
was very unwilling to let her run away so quickly,
and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind until she could
take her to Bath herself after Christmas; but with commitments from
her own who has to take her away from Kellynch for a few weeks, she was
unable to give the full invitation she wished, and Anne was scared dread
the possible heat of September in all the white light of Bath, and
grieving to renounce all influence so sweet and so sad of the
autumn months in the country, did not think that, everything
considered, she wanted to stay.It would be the most correct and the most
wise, and therefore must entail the least suffering to go with the others.However, something happened to change her duty.Mary, often
a little sick, and always thinking a lot about her own
complaints, and always the habit of claiming Anne if there was anything
the case was menstruating; and foresaw that they had no
day health all fall, begged, or rather demanded her, for it
was hardly a plea to come to Uppercross Cottage and carry her
company for as long as she wanted her, instead of going to Bath."There's no way I can do without Anne," Mary reasoned; and
Elizabeth's answer was: 'Then I'm sure Anne better stay, for no one
will want her in Bath."

To be claimed as a good, although in an inappropriate style, is at least at
better than being rejected as not good at all; and Anne, happy with that
came up with something useful, glad that something has been marked as a duty, and ...
certainly don't regret having the scene of it in the country, and her own
Dear country, immediately agreed to stay.This invitation from Mary has taken all of Lady Russell's troubles away, and...
it was therefore soon decided that Anne would not go to Bath
Lady Russell took her, and that should be the whole time in between
divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.So far everything was perfect; but Lady Russell was almost startled
the wrong part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it erupted on her,
that was, Mrs Clay is engaged to be with Sir Walter and
Elizabeth, as a very important and valuable assistant to the latter in
all business for her.Lady Russell deeply regretted that
such a measure should have been taken, surprised, saddened,
and feared; and the insult it held to Anne, in Mrs. Clay's being...
of so much use, while Anne could be of nothing, was a very painful
aggravation.Anne herself was hardened against such insults; but she felt the
carelessness of the arrangement as sharp as Lady Russell.Right away
lots of silent observation, and an acquaintance, which they often
wished less, of her father's character, she was sensible that results
the most serious for his family's intimacy were over
possible.She couldn't imagine her father having an idea right now
of the kind.Mrs. Clay had freckles and a protruding tooth, and a...
clumsy wrist, about which he constantly made serious remarks, in
her absence; but she was young and certainly very pretty,
and possessed, with a keen mind and diligent pleasant manners,
infinitely more dangerous attractions than any mere personal power
have been.Anne was so impressed by the degree of danger that ...
she couldn't stop herself from trying to make it visible to her
sister.She had little hope of success; but Elizabeth, who in the ...
the case of such a reversal would be so much more regrettable than
herself, she thought, would never have reason to blame her haar
don't give a warning.She spoke, and only seemed to insult.Elizabeth could not understand how
such an absurd suspicion must have occurred to her, and replied indignantly:
for any party that knows their situation perfectly.Clay, she said warmly, never forget who she is and who I am
more familiar with her feelings than you can be, can I
make sure that they are special in the matter of marriage:
nice, and that she more rejects all inequalities of fitness and rank
strong than most people.And as for my father, I really shouldn't
have thought that he who has kept himself single for us for so long
sakes, should now be suspected.If Mrs. Clay was a very beautiful woman,
I admit it may be wrong to have her with me so often; not that
I'm sure anything in the world would lead my father to a...
humiliating match, but he might become unhappy.But poor Mrs. Clay
which, with all its merits, can never be considered acceptable
I really think poor Mrs. Clay is staying here perfectly
safety.You might think you've never heard my dad talk about her
personal setbacks, although I know you have to fifty times.that tooth
hair and those freckles.Freckles don't disgust me so much
like they do him.I have known a face that was not materially deformed by a ...
few, but he detests them.You must have heard that he noticed Mrs Clay's
freckles."

“There is hardly any personal flaw,” Anne replied
pleasant way may not gradually reconcile with."

"I think very differently," replied Elizabeth curtly; "a pleasant one
way can produce beautiful features, but can never change the ordinary.But anyway, because I have a lot more at stake here
point than anyone else can have, I think it's kind of superfluous with you
to advise me."

Anne had done; glad it was over, and not absolutely hopeless of it
doing well.Elizabeth, although she resents the suspicion, perhaps she is...
taken into account by it.The last office of the four carriage horses was to draw Sir Walter,
Miss Elliot and Mrs Clay to Bath.The group drove off very well
ghosts; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all
haunted tenants and cottagers who might have had a hint to show
herself, and Anne walked upstairs at the same time, in a kind of desolation
rest, to the Lodge, where she would spend the first week.Her friend wasn't in a better mood than herself.Lady Russell felt
this family break is extraordinary.Their respect was like that
dear to her as hers, and daily intercourse was made precious by
habit.It was painful to look at their deserted grounds, and still are
worse to anticipate the new hands they would fall into; and to escape
the loneliness and melancholy of a village so changed, and be out
from the way Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived she had decided:
to start her own absence from home when she has to give up Anne.Accordingly, their removal was made together, and Anne was put down with
Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage of Lady Russell's journey.Uppercross was a medium-sized village that a few years ago
has been entirely in the old English style, containing only two houses
superior in appearance to that of the yeomen and workers; the
the squire's mansion, with its high walls, large gates and old trees,
substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, austere rectory,
enclosed in its own neat garden, trained with a vine and a pear tree
around its frames; but so was the marriage of the young squire
got the improvement of a farm elevated to a cottage, for
his home, and Uppercross Cottage, with its porch, French
windows and other beauty, was just as good to capture the
travelers eye as the more consistent and significant aspect and
buildings of the Big House, about a quarter of a mile away.Anne often stayed here.She knew the ways of Uppercross like
as well as that of Kellynch.The two families were so constantly
meeting, so often in the habit of running in and out of each other
house at all times, that it was quite a surprise for her to find Mary
only; but being alone she was almost unwell and excited
naturally.Though better off than the older sister, Mary
did not have Anne's understanding or temper.Though good, and happy, and
well-groomed, she had a great good humor and an excellent spirit;
but every period has completely sunk her.She had no resources for it
loneliness; and inheriting a significant portion of the Elliot
self-righteousness, was very inclined to add to any other suffering that of
self neglected and misused.Personally she was inferior to
both sisters, and, even in her prime, had only attained the dignity of
"being a nice girl".She was now lying on the faded sofa of the beautiful one
small parlor, which had once been elegant furniture
gradually worn out, under the influence of four and two summers
children; and when Anne appeared she greeted her with…

"So you finally came! I started to think I'd never see you.I
am so sick i can barely speak.I have not seen a whole creature yet
morning!"

"I'm sorry not to like you," Anne replied.'You got me like that
good of yourself on Thursday! "

"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do: but I was far from good
at that moment; and I don't think I've ever been as sick in my life as I've been
been all morning: very unfit to be left alone I'm sure.Suppose I was suddenly grabbed in a terrible way, and not ...
can ring the bell! So Lady Russell wouldn't come out.I do not do
think she's been to this house three times this summer."

Anne said what was appropriate and inquired about her husband."Oh!
Charles is shooting.I haven't seen him in seven hours.He
even though I told him how sick I was.He said not to stay
long out; but he never came back, and now it's almost one.I
assure you, I haven't seen a soul this very long morning."

"Have you had your sons with you?"

'Yes, as long as I could bear their noise, but they are so unmanageable
that they do me more harm than good.Little Charles doesn't mind a
I say, and Walter grows just as bad."

"Well, you'll get well soon," Anne replied cheerfully."YOU
know that I always heal you when I come.How are your neighbors at it
Great house?"

"I can't account for it.I haven't seen one
today, except for Mr. Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the
window, but without getting off his horse; and though I told him how
I was sick, not one of them has been near me.It didn't happen
suits the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never failed themselves
from their way."

"You might see them before the morning is over".It is
asked."

'I never want them, I assure you.They also talk and laugh a lot
a lot to me.Oh! Anne, I am so very sick! It was quite rude on
you should not come on thursday."

My dear Mary, think what a nice report you sent me
yourself! You wrote in the happiest way and said you ...
perfect, and without rush for me; and if so, you
need to realize it would be my wish to stay with Lady Russell until the ...
last one: and aside from how i felt for her, i really have been like this
busy, I've had so much to do I couldn't do it so easily gemakkelijk
left Kellynch before."

"My dear! What the hell can you do?"

'A lot of things, I assure you.More than I can remember in one
moment; but i can tell you something.I made a duplicate of it
catalog of my father's books and pictures.I've been there several times
in the yard with Mackenzie, trying to understand and force him
understand, which of Elizabeth's plants are for Lady Russell?.I have
had all my own little worries to arrange, books and music to distribute,
and all my bags to pack, because I didn't understand in time what
was meant with regard to the wagons: and one thing I had to do, Mary,
of a more tried-and-true nature: going to almost every house in the parish, such as
a kind of departure.I was told they wanted it.But all these
things took a long time."

"Oh yeah!" and after a short pause, 'but you never asked me
one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday."

'Did you go then? I did not inquire because I have decided on you
must have been obliged to give up the party."

"Oh yes! I went.I was very good yesterday; nothing at all
with me until this morning.It would have been strange if I hadn't
away."

"I am very happy that you were healthy enough and I hope you had a nice holiday."
party."

"Nothing remarkable.One always knows in advance what the dinner will be
be, and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable to have none
own transport.Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove took me and we were
pressure! They are both so big and take up so much space; and mr
Musgrove always sits forward.So there I was, packed in the back
sits with Henrietta and Louisa; and I consider it very likely that my
illness may be due to it today."

A little more persistence in patience and enforced cheerfulness
Anne's side almost healed Mary.She was soon able to sit
upright on the couch, and began to hope that maybe she could leave it by
dinner time.Then, forgetting to remember, she was on the other side
decorating the room, a posy; then she ate her cold meat; and
then she was good enough to suggest a walk."Where shall we go?" she said when they were done ...."I guess you
will not like to visit the Big House until they have been to see
you?"

'I don't have the slightest objection to that,' Anne replied."I
should never think of attending such a ceremony with people I know so
as well as Mrs. and Miss Musgroves."

"Oh! but they should call on you ASAP.".They should
to feel your due as my sister.But we might as well go
and sit with them for a while, and when we get that over, we can
enjoy our walk."

Anne had always thought such a style of association extremely imprudent;
but she had stopped trying to control it because she believed that,
though insulting subjects were constantly on both sides, neither
family could do without it now.Accordingly to the Big House
sat down in the old-fashioned square drawing room for the full half hour,
with a small carpet and shiny floor, on which the present daughters
of the house gradually gave the right atmosphere of confusion by a
grand piano forte and a harp, flower stands and tables in it
any direction.Oh! the originals of the portraits were against the
wainscot, the gentlemen could be in brown velvet and the ladies in blue
satin saw what was going on have been aware of it
overthrow of all order and neatness! The portraits themselves seemed
standing stunned staring.The Musgroves, like their homes, were in a state of rebuilding,
maybe for improvement.The father and mother were in old English
style, and the young in the new.Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove were a
very good kind of people; friendly and welcoming, not much trained,
and not at all elegant.Their children had a more modern mind and
manners.There was a large number of families; but the only two grew up
with the exception of Charles, Henrietta and Louisa were young ladies of nineteen years old
and twenty, who had brought all the usual supplies from school in Exeter
of achievements, and were now like thousands of other young ladies,
live to be fashionable, happy and cheerful.Their dress had every
advantage, their faces were rather beautiful, their minds extreme
well, their shy and pleasant manner; they mattered
at home, and favorites abroad.Anne always regarded them as some
of the happiest creatures of her knowledge; yet, saved as we are
all are, by wishing a comfortable sense of superiority
the possibility of exchange, she would not have given up on her own
elegant and cultivated spirit for all their pleasure; and envied them
nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement
together, that good-humored mutual affection she'd known ...
so little herself with one of her sisters.They were received with great cordiality.Nothing seemed wrong on the
side of the Great House family, which was generally, like Anne, very good
knew, the slightest fault.The half hour was pleasantly scrambled away
enough; and at the end of it she wasn't surprised at all
their walking party accompanied by the two Miss Musgroves, at Mary's
special invitation.Chapter 6


Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross to learn that it was a move
from one group of people to another, but at a distance of only three
miles, often involves a total change of conversation, opinion and
idea.She had never been there before without being mugged
it, or without wishing that other Elliots might take her advantage in
given how unknown or thoughtless things were there
Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervasive
to interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed she had to do it now
admit to feeling that other lesson, in the art of knowing ours
nothing outside of our own circle had become necessary to her; in front of
certainly, as she came, with a heart full of the subject that
had both houses in Kellynch fully occupied for weeks,
she had expected a little more curiosity and sympathy than in it
Mr and Mrs Musgrove's separate but very similar comment: "So, Miss
Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of bath do you do
think they will settle in? ”and this, without waiting much for one
answer; or in the addition of the young ladies, "I hope we are there
Bath in the winter; but remember, daddy, if we go we gotta be in a ...
good situation: none of your Queen Squares for us! ”or in the frightened one
complement of Mary, from - "On my word I'll be pretty good,
when you are all gone to be happy in Bath! "

She could only decide to avoid and reflect on such self-deception in the future
with heightened gratitude for the extraordinary blessing of having one
such a genuinely compassionate friend like Lady Russell.The Mr. Musgroves had their own game to guard and destroy their own
horses, dogs and newspapers to engage them, and the females were completely
busy with all other common household subjects, neighbors,
dress, dance and music.She recognized it was very appropriate,
that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own affairs
discourse; and hoped to soon become a not unworthy member of the
one she was now transplanted into.With the prospect of joining
at least two months at Uppercross, it was a tough job for her
cloths her imagination, her memory and all her ideas in as much of it
Uppercross possible.She had no fear for these two months.Mary wasn't so repulsive and
our sister as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all the influence of her;
nor was there anything between the other constituent parts of the
cottage hostile to comfort.She was always on friendly terms with her
brother in law; and with the children, who loved her almost as much, and
respected her much more than their mother, she had a purpose for that
interest, entertainment and healthy exercise.Charles Musgrove was polite and pleasant; in feeling and temperament he was
undoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers or conversation,
or grace, to make the past, as they were connected, a at all
dangerous contemplation; but at the same time Anne could believe,
with Lady Russell, that a more equal match would have improved significantly
him; and that a woman with real understanding could have given more
consequence for its character, and greater utility, rationality, and
elegance to his habits and pursuits.As it was, he did nothing with it
a lot of zeal, but sports; otherwise his time was in vain without it
take advantage of books or something else.He was in a very good mood, what
never seemed very affected by his wife's occasional weakness, bored with...
her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne's admiration, and on the...
entirely, although very often there was a slight disagreement (in which they
sometimes had more share than she wished, addressed by both
parties), they can pass for a happy couple.They were always
perfectly agreed in the lack of more money, and a strong tendency incl
for a nice present from his father; but here, as with most subjects,
had the superiority, because while Mary thought it a great shame that such
no presents were given, he always fought for having his father
many other uses for his money, and the right to spend it as he pleased.As for the management of their children, his theory was much better than...
from his wife, and his practice is not so bad."I could handle them very well"
Well, if it wasn't for Mary's intervention, ”was what Anne often said
heard him say, and was very confident; but when listening
turn to Maria's reproach of 'Charles spoils the children so that I
can't get them in any particular order, 'she's never had the slightest temptation
to say, "Very true."

One of the least pleasant circumstances of her stay there was her
are treated with too much confidence by all parties, and that too
much in secret from every home's complaints.Known to have some
influence in her sister, she was constantly asked, or at least
receiving hints to practice it beyond what was practical."I wish you
persuaded Mary not to always think she was sick," was...
Charles' language; and in an unhappy mood Mary spoke thus:
believe if Charles saw me die he wouldn't think there was
whatever is wrong with me.I'm sure, Anne, if you wanted to, you might
convince him that I'm really, really sick - much worse than ever before
own."

Mary's statement was, "I hate to send the kids to the Big One
House, although their grandmother always wants to see them because she
humor and spoil them to such an extent, and give them so much
garbage and sweet things, that they will surely come back sick and angry
for the rest of the day.And Mrs. Musgrove took the first opportunity
from being alone with Anne, to saying, "Oh! Miss Anne, I can't help but wish
Mrs. Charles had a bit of your method with those kids.They are
very different creatures with you! But to be sure, in general they are
are so spoiled! It's a shame you can't get in your sister's way
they manage.They are just as fine healthy children as have ever been seen,
poor babies! without bias; but Mrs. Charles doesn't remember
how they should be treated -! Bless me! how tricky they are
sometimes.I assure you, Miss Anne, it prevents me from wanting to see them
at our house as often as I should otherwise.I believe Mrs. Charles is
I am not entirely happy that I have not invited them more often; but you know it is
very bad to have children with one that must be monitored
every moment; "don't do this" and "don't do that;" or that is possible
only keep in acceptable order by more cake than is good for them."

She also had this communication from Mary."Mrs. Musgrove thinks
all her servants so steadfast that it would be high treason to invoke it
ask; but I am sure, without exaggeration, that its upper
housekeeper and laundry, instead of being in their business are
sniff through the village all day long.I meet them wherever I go;
and I declare: I never go to my nursery twice without seeing it
something of them.If Jemima weren't the most reliable, steadfast
creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her; because she tells
me, they always tempt her to go for a walk with them."And on Mrs
Musgrove's side, it was, "I make a rule never to meddle in any of...
my daughter-in-law's worries, for I know it wouldn't work; But I will
tell you Miss Anne because maybe you can fix things
that I don't have such a good opinion of Mrs. Charles's nanny: I hear that
strange stories about her; she is always on the right track; and of my own
know, I can say, she is such a beautiful lady, she is
enough to ruin any servants she comes near.Mrs. Charles swears very much
because of her, I know; but i'm just giving you this hint so you might be on the...
watch; because if you see something wrong, don't be afraid of it
mentioning."

Again, it was Mary's complaint that Mrs. Musgrove was very inclined not to
give her the precedence she was due when they dined at the Great Grote
House with other families; and she saw no reason why she was waarom
to be considered so at home that she would lose her place.And one day
when Anne walked with only the Musgroves, one of them after
talking about rank, people of rank and jealousy of rank, said, "I have no
don't you know how stupid some people are
their place, because the whole world knows how easy and indifferent you are
are left; but I wish someone could give Mary a hint that they could ...
a lot better if she wasn't that tenacious, especially if
she wouldn't always put herself forward to take mom's place.No one questions her right to have priority over Mommy, but it would
become more into her not to insist on it all the time.That's not it
Mommy cares the least, but I know it's taken
notification by many persons."

How was Anne supposed to set all these things right? There was little she could do
more than patiently listening, softening every complaint and apologizing to everyone for
the other; give them all the hints of the forbearance needed between
such close neighbors, and make those hints the widest that were intended
for the good of her sister.In all other respects her visit started and went very well.Her
own mind improved by change of place and subject, by being removed being
three miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments were reduced by having a
constant companion and their daily dealings with the other family,
because there was no superior affection, trust, or work
in the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage.It
was certainly carried as far as possible, because they all met
morning, and almost never spent an evening; but she believed
they shouldn't have done so well without seeing mr and madam
Musgrove's respectable shapes in the usual places, or without the
talking, laughing and singing of their daughters.She played a lot better than any of the Miss Musgroves, but
no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no loving parents, to sit
by feeling enraptured, her performance was little thought out
off, just as courtesy, or to freshen up the others, as she was fine
aware.She knew that when she played, she only gave pleasure
herself; but this was not a new sensation.With the exception of a short period of
she had never had her life since she was fourteen, never since
loss of her dear mother, the happiness known to be listened to, or
encouraged by some just appreciation or real taste.In music she had
always been used to feeling alone in the world; and Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove
great fondness for the achievements of their own daughters, and total
indifference to another, gave her much more pleasure
their good, then mortification for her own.The party in the Grote Huis was sometimes enhanced by a different company.The neighborhood wasn't big, but the Musgroves were frequented by
everyone, and had more dinners, and more callers, more visitors
by invitation and by chance, than any other family.They were more
totally popular.The girls loved to dance; and the evenings ended now and then
in an unintentional ball.There was a family of cousins ​​inside
a walk through Uppercross, in less affluent conditions, which depended on
the Musgroves for all their pleasure: they would come anytime,
and play with everything, or dance everywhere; and Anne, very much
prefer the office of musician to a more active post, played country
dances to them together every hour; a kindness that always
recommended her musical powers to the attention of Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove
more than anything, and often drew this compliment; - "Well done,
Miss Anne! very well done indeed! Lord bless me! how that little one
fingers of yours fly around! "

So successful the first three weeks.Michael came; and now Anne's heart
must be back in Kellynch.A beloved home left to others; all the
precious rooms and furniture, groves and prospects, which began to own
different eyes and different limbs! She couldn't think of much else about the
Sept. 29; and in the evening she had that sympathetic touch
of Mary, who, on the occasion of writing the day of the month,
exclaimed, “Dear me, this is not the day the Crofts would come
Kellynch? I'm glad I didn't think about it sooner.How low is it?
me!"

The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and would be
visited.Mary lamented the necessity for herself."Nobody Knew How"
she would have to suffer a lot.She should put it off as long as she could; '
but it was not easy until she persuaded Charles to persuade her
an early day, and was in a very animated, comfortable state of being
imaginary excitement, when she came back.Anne had very sincere
rejoiced that she could not go.She wished, however
see the Crofts, and was happy to be in when the visit returned.They came: the master of the house was not at home, but the two
sisters were together; and when it happened to be Mrs Croft on the...
part of Anne, while the admiral sat next to Mary, and was very upset
pleasantly pleased with his good-humored comment about her sons, she was doing well
able to look at a resemblance, and if she failed in the features, to
catch it in the voice, or in the turn of sentiment and expression.Though Mrs Croft was neither tall nor fat, she had a straightness, sincerity,
and power of form, which gave importance to her person.She had
bright dark eyes, good teeth and all in all a pleasant sight; although
her red and weathered complexion, the result of her
having been at sea almost as often as her husband, she seemed to have done so
lived several years longer in the world than her real thirty-eight.Her manners were open, easy and determined, like one who had no mistrust
of itself, and no doubt about what to do; without any approximation to it
rudeness, however, or any lack of good humor.Anne gave her credit,
indeed, for feelings of great self-esteem in everything
that pertained to Kellynch, and she liked it: especially, as she had
satisfied himself in the very first half minute, at the moment even from
introduction, that there was not the slightest symptom of any knowledge
or suspicion on the part of Mrs Croft, to give some sort of bias.She was
quite easy on that head, and therefore full of strength and courage,
electrified for a moment by Mrs. Croft's sudden saying: -

'It was you, and not your sister, I think my brother had it
pleasure to meet you while he was in this country."

Anne hoped she had survived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion
she sure didn't."Maybe you haven't heard he's married?" added Mrs Croft.She could now answer as she should; and was happy to feel it, then madam
The following words from Croft stated that it was Mr. Wentworth who she was talking about:
that she hadn't said anything that would help neither brother ....They
immediately felt how reasonable it was that Mrs. Croft should be
think and talk about Edward, not Frederick; and with shame
in her own forgetfulness she applied herself to the knowledge of them
the current state of the former neighbor with the correct interest.The rest was all rest; until, just as they were moving, they ...
heard the admiral say to Mary:

“We are expecting a brother of Mrs. Croft here soon; I dare to tell you
know him by name."

It was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys who clung to
he is like an old friend, and declares not to go; and also his
very preoccupied with proposing to carry them away in his coat pockets,
&c., to have one more moment to finish or remember what he had
started, Anne was left to convince herself as best she could
the same brother must still be involved.However, she couldn't
achieve such a degree of certainty that you need not be afraid to hear whether:
something was said about it in the other house, where the...
Crofts had called before.The people of the Great House would spend the evening of this day at
the little house; and it is now too late in the year for such visits to
on foot, the coach began to be listened to when the
youngest Miss Musgrove entered.That she came to apologize,
and that they should spend the evening alone, was the
first black idea; and Mary was all ready to be insulted when Louisa
made up for by saying she only came on foot, to leave more
room for the harp, which brought in the carriage.“And I'll tell you our reason,” she added, “and all about it ....I am
come on to let you know mom and dad are no good this
evening, especially Mom; she thinks so much of poor Richard!
And we agreed that it would be best to have the harp because it seems to be fun
its more than the piano forte.I'll tell you why she's gone
ghosts.When the Crofts called this morning, (they called here
afterwards, didn't they?), they happened to say that her brother,
Captain Wentworth, has just returned to England, either paid off, or...
something, and comes to see them almost immediately; and most
unfortunately it came to mom's head when they were gone that
Wentworth, or something very similar, was poor Richard's name
captain at the same time; I don't know where or when, but for a long time
before he died, poor fellow! And when looking at his letters and
things, she thought it was, and is absolutely sure it must be
the man himself, and her head is all over it, and poor Richard!
So we must be as cheerful as we can, lest she think about it stil
such gloomy things."

The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,
that the Musgroves had had the accident of a very troublesome,
hopeless son; and the luck of losing him before he reached his reached
twentieth year; that he was sent to sea because he was stupid and
unmanageable ashore; that he was not cared for in any way
time spent by his family, though he earned as much as he did; rarely heard
of, and scarcely regret, when the intelligence of his death
abroad had made their way to Uppercross two years earlier.In fact, he had, although his sisters now did everything they could for ...
calling him "poor Richard," nothing better than a ...
thick-headed, numb, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done it before
anything that gives right to more than the abbreviation of his name,
alive or dead.He had been at sea for several years, and in the course of that time
removals for which all midshipmen are liable, and especially the like
midshipmen, like every captain wants to get rid of, are six months away
board Captain Frederick Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and of the
Laconia, under the influence of his captain, he had written the only one
two letters that his father and mother had once received from him
during his entire absence; that is, the only two
uninterested letters; the rest was just a request for
money.In every letter he had spoken well of his captain; yet so little
they used to deal with such matters, so inattentive and
ignorant were they of the names of men or ships it had made
hardly impressed at the time; and that's what Mrs. Musgrove should have done
today suddenly struck by the memory of the name of
Wentworth, as related to her son, seemed like one of those extraordinary
outbursts of the mind that sometimes occur.She had gone to her letters and found it all as she supposed; and the
rethinking these letters, after such a long pause, her poor son
gone forever, forgetting all the power of his mistakes, had
greatly affected her mind, and cast her over in greater sorrow
him than she had known when she first heard of his death.Mr. Musgrove was,
also affected to a lesser extent; and when they reached the
cottage, they evidently needed to be listened to again
on this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief that aroused
companions could give them.To hear them talk so much about Captain Wentworth, repeating his name...
so often, puzzling over the years, and finally finding it
would, that it probably would, turn out to be the same captain
Wentworth whom they remembered, once or twice, after their ...
coming back from Clifton - a very fine young man - but they couldn't tell
whether it was seven or eight years ago was a new kind of trial
Anne's nerves.However, she found that it was one she had to comply with
inure himself.Since he was actually expected in the country, she had to
teach yourself to be insensitive on such points punten.And not alone
seem that he was expected, and soon, but the Musgroves, in their
heartfelt gratitude for the kindness he had shown poor Dick, and very high
respect for his character, stamped as it was by the fact that it had been poor Dick
six months under his care, and he called him strong, but not
perfectly spelled praise, like "a fine dashing fellow, just two"
quirk about the schoolmaster, "were planning to introduce"
themselves, and looking for his knowledge as soon as they could hear of it
his coming.The resolution to do this helped shape the comfort of their evening.chapter 7


Just a few more days and it was announced that Captain Wentworth was at...
Kellynch and Mr Musgrove had called him and returned warm in his
praise, and he was engaged to the Crofts to dine at Uppercross, by
the end of a new week.It had been a great disappointment to Mr
Musgrove to find that no previous day could be solved, was so impatient
him to show his gratitude by seeing Captain Wentworth alone...
roof, and welcomed him to all that was strongest and best in his
cellars.But a week must pass; only a week, according to Anne's account, and
then, she supposed, they should meet; and soon she began to wish her
can even feel safe for a week.Captain Wentworth returned very early to Mr. Musgrove's courtesy,
and she called there in almost the same half hour.She and Mary
were actually on their way to the Big House, where, like them
later they heard inevitably found him, when they were
stopped by the eldest boy's creature at that time brought home
as a result of a serious fall.The situation of the child brought the visit
completely aside; but she couldn't hear of her escape with indifference,
even in the midst of the severe fear they felt afterward
his account.His collarbone was found to be dislocated, and one such injury sustained
the back, as aroused the most alarming ideas.It was an afternoon of
grief, and Anne had to do everything at once; the pharmacy of apotheek
let come, have chased and informed the father, have the mother
support and stay from hysteria, the servants to check, the youngest
child to banish, and the poor who suffer to nurture and soothe;
in addition to sending, as soon as she remembered, a good notification to the
another house that paid tribute to her instead of scared,
asking companions, then of very useful assistants.Her brother's return was the first consolation; he could take care of the best
his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the pharmacist.Until he came and examined the child, their fears were the
worse because it is vague; they suspected major injuries, but did not know where;
but now the collarbone was quickly replaced, and though Mr. Robinson felt ...
and felt, and rubbed, and looked earnest, and spoke low words to both
father and aunt, yet they all had to hope for the best, and
able to say goodbye and eat their dinner in acceptable peace of mind; and then
it was just before they broke up that the two young aunts could
far to deviate from their cousin's state, to give the information of
visit from Captain Wentworth; five minutes behind their father and
mother, to try to express how utterly delighted they were
he, how much more handsome, how infinitely more pleasant they found him
than any individual under their male acquaintance, who had been at all
a favorite before.How happy they had been to hear that Daddy invited him
keep eating, what a pity when he said it was completely out of his power, and
how happy again when he promised in answer to mom and dad
further urgent invitations to dine with them at the
tomorrow - actually the next day; and he had promised it in such a pleasant a
way, as if he already felt the motive of their attention, just like him
should.And in short, he had seen and said everything with such a thing
excellent grace that they could assure them all, their heads were both
turned by him; and they ran away, just as cheerful as love, and ...
apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than little Charles.The same story and the same rapture were repeated when the two girls
came with their father, through the twilight of the evening, to
questions; and Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness
his heir, could add his affirmation and praise, and hope that would happen
don't take an opportunity now to depose Captain Wentworth, and only regret
to think that the cottage party probably wouldn't want to leave the house
little boy, to give him the congregation."Oh no; as for leaving the little one
boy," both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm
to endure the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape, couldn't help it
adding her warm protests to theirs.Charles Musgrove indeed showed more inclination afterwards; "the
the child was doing so well and he was so eager to meet
Captain Wentworth, that he might join them in the evening; he
wouldn't eat from home, but he could walk in for half an hour."But
in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with "Oh! no, indeed,
Charles, I can't bear you leaving.Only think when there is something
has to happen?"

The child had a good night, and the next day was fine.It
must be a time consuming job to ensure that no damage has been done to the
vertebral column; but Mr. Robinson found nothing to increase anxiety, and Charles
As a result, Musgrove began to feel no need anymore
incarceration.The child had to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible
possible; but what should a father do? This was quite the one
case of a woman, and it would be most absurd in him who could be of nothing
at home, to lock themselves up.His father wished him very much
meet Captain Wentworth, and there is no sufficient reason against...
it, he should go; and it ended in making a bold, public
statement, when he came in from the shooting, of his intention to dress
immediately, and dine in the other house."Nothing could be better than the child," he said; "so I told my
Dad, just now that I was coming, and he thought I was absolutely right.Your sister is with you, my love, I have no qualms at all.YOU
wouldn't want to leave him myself, but you see I can't be of no use.Anne will get me if something is wrong."

Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be in vain.Mary knew, from Charles's way of speaking, that he was quite...
determined to go, and that there would be no point in teasing him.They
therefore said nothing until he was out of the room, but as soon as
only Anne could be heard ...

'So you and I just have to shift with these poor sick
child; and not a creature that comes near us all evening! I knew how
it would be.This is always my happiness.If there is something
obnoxious men will always come out for sure, and Charles
is just as bad as any of them.Very numb! I have to say it is bad
impervious to him running away from his poor little boy.Conversations about
he is doing so well! How does he know he's fine
or that there may be no sudden change in half an hour? I do not have
think Charles would have been so numb.So here he has to get out
and enjoy, and because I'm the poor mother, I can't be
may stir; and yet I'm sure I'm unfit than anyone else
to deal with the child.Being the mother is exactly why my
feelings should not be tested.I'm not equal to it at all.you saw
how hysterical was i yesterday."

But that was only the effect of the sudden burst of your alarm - of the
shock.You won't be hysterical anymore.Dare I say we'll have it
nothing to upset us.I understand Mr Robinson perfectly
directions, and have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I can't be surprised ...
your husband.Nursing is not a man's; it's not his
province.A sick child is always the property of the mother: her own
feelings generally make it so."

"I hope I love my child as much as any mother, but I don't know"
I'm more useful in the sickroom than Charles, because I can't be
always scolding and teasing the poor child when he is sick; and you saw
this morning, if I told him to shut up, he'd definitely start ...
kick over.I have no nerves for things like that."

'But, would you feel comfortable spending the whole thing
night away from the poor boy?"

'Yes; you see his daddy can, and why shouldn't I? jemima is so
careful; and she could let us know what he was like every hour.I really do
think Charles might as well have told his father we were all coming.I
am now no more alarmed about little Charles than he is.I was
Terribly alarmed yesterday, but things are very different today."

"Well if you think it's not too late to cancel for yourself,
what if you went, as did your husband?.Let little Charles
to my concern.Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove can't go wrong as long as I stay
with him."

"Are you serious?" cried Mary with shining eyes."Dear me! That is
a very good thought, very good, indeed.To be sure, I might as well
go like not because i'm home of no use - am i? and it just torments me.You, who don't have the feelings of a mother, are in large part the best clean
person.You can make little Charles do anything; he always watches you
in a word.It will be much better than leaving him alone with
jemima.Oh! I will definitely go; I'm sure I should if I can, just like
just like Charles, because they want me to get too acquainted with ...
Captain Wentworth, and I know you don't mind being left alone....A
an excellent thought from you, indeed, Anne.I'm going to tell Charles,
and get ready immediately.You can have us come in an instant
pay attention if something is wrong; but I dare say there will be nothing
to alert you.I wouldn't go, you can be sure, if I didn't feel
very comfortable about my sweet child."

The next moment she knocked on her husband's dressing room door,
and when Anne followed her up the stairs she was in time for the whole
conversation, which began with Mary's words, in a tone of grand...
elation--

'I want to go with you, Charles, because I can't get home anymore
you are.If I locked myself up with the kid forever, I should
not being able to convince him to do something he didn't like.Anne will
stay; Anne promises to stay at home and take care of him.It is
Anne's own proposal, and so I'm going with you, which will be great
deal better as I haven't eaten at the other house since Tuesday."

'This is very kind of Anne', her husband replied, 'and I should be too
very glad you are going; but it seems rather difficult that she should be
left home alone to take care of our sick child."

Anne was now ready to take up her own cause and the sincerity of her
way that was soon enough to convince him, where the conviction was ready
least pleasant, he had no further qualms about leaving her behind
to dine alone, although he still wanted her to join them in the evening,
when the child could be at rest at night, and kindly urged her
let him come for her, but she could not be convinced; and this
if it did, she soon had the pleasure of seeing them leave
together in good spirits.They were gone, she hoped, to be happy,
however strangely constructed such happiness may seem; as for herself,
she was left with as many feelings of comfort as perhaps ever
probably hers.She knew she was from the first usefulness of the
child; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth was only a half
miles away, making him pleasing to others?

She would have liked to know how he felt about meeting.Perhaps
indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.He
must be either indifferent or unwilling.Had he ever wanted to see her?
again, he did not have to wait until this time; he would have done something
she couldn't help but believe she should have taken a long time in his place
ago, when events were early and gave him the independence that only
had missed.Her brother and sister returned happy with their new knowledge,
and their visit in general.There had been music, sung, talk,
laughing, it was all very pleasant; charming manners in Captain
Wentworth, no shyness or restraint; they all seemed to know each other
perfect, and he came the next morning to shoot with
Charles.He was supposed to come for breakfast, but not at The Cottage
that was first suggested; but then he was pressed to come
to the Big House instead, and he seemed scared of getting into Mrs.
Charles Musgrove's way, because of the child, and therefore,
somehow they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles' being to meet him
to have breakfast with his father.Anne understood.He didn't want to see her.Did he ask
after her she found something, as a former weakness would fit
knowledge, which seemed to recognize what it had recognized,
perhaps driven by the same view to escape introduction when they are
would meet.The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the
another house, and the next day the difference was so great that Mary
and Anne had only just finished breakfast when Charles came in...
say they just left, that he came for his dogs,
that his sisters followed with Captain Wentworth; his sisters
I want to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth proposes
also to wait for her for a few minutes, if not inconveniently; and however
Charles had replied that the child was not in such a state as could be...
make it tricky, Captain Wentworth wouldn't be happy without it
are running to give up.Mary, very pleased with this attention, was delighted to receive it
him, while a thousand feelings stormed over Anne, of which this is the
comforting that it would soon be over.And it was over quickly.In
two minutes after Charles' preparation, the others appeared; they were
in the salon.Her eye met half Captain Wentworth's, a bow, a ...
bend over; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary, said all that ...
was right, said something to Miss Musgroves, enough to mark a cinch
foot; the room seemed full, full of people and voices, but a few
minutes it ended.Charles showed himself to the window, everything was ready,
their visitor had bowed and was gone, Miss Musgroves were gone too,
suddenly deciding to walk to the end of the village with the
athletes: the room was vacated and Anne might eat her breakfast
as she could."It's over! It's over!" she repeated to herself over and over, in
nervous gratitude."The worst is over!"

Mary talked, but she couldn't come.She had seen him.They had
Met.They had been in the same room again.But soon she started to reason with herself and try to feel
less.Eight years, almost eight years had passed since everything had been
gave up.How absurd to resume the agitation such
interval was relegated to distance and obscurity! Maybe not
do eight years? Events of any description, changes, alienations,
deletions - everything, everything must be contained in it, and the oblivion of the past--
how natural, how sure! It comprised almost a third of her
own life.Unfortunately! with all her reasoning, she found it to be persistent feelings
eight years may be little more than nothing.Now how were his feelings to be read? Was this like wanting?
Avoid her? And the next moment she hated herself for the folly
who asked the question.On another question that may not have her utmost wisdom
avoided, she was soon spared all tension; before, after the miss
Musgroves had returned and ended their visit to the cottage she had
this spontaneous information from Mary: -

"Captain Wentworth is not very brave of you, Anne, although he was like that ...
considerate of me.Henrietta asked him what he thought of you when she...
left, and he said, “You were so changed he shouldn't have known
You again.'"

Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister's in an ordinary way,
but she was completely innocent of inflicting something special
wound."Changed beyond his knowledge.Anne completely surrendered, in silence, deeply
mortification.No doubt it was, and she couldn't take revenge because
he hadn't changed, or worse.She had already recognized it
it to herself, and she couldn't think otherwise, let him think of
her as he would.No: the years that destroyed her youth and
Bloom had just given him a more radiant, masculine, open look, in no
respect diminishing his personal benefits.She saw the same
Frederick Wentworth."Changed so much he shouldn't have known her!" These were words
who had no choice but to live with her.Still, she soon began to enjoy it
she had heard them.They were of sobering inclination; they decreased
agitation; they composed, and therefore had to make her happier.Frederick Wentworth had used words like that, or something like that, but...
without a clue that they would be carried to her.He had
thought she had changed miserably, and at the first moment of appeal, had...
spoken the way he felt.He had not forgiven Anne Elliot.She had used it
sick, abandoned and disappointed him; and worse, she had shown that
weakness of character in doing so, what he decided himself, self-assured
mood could not bear.She had given him up to serve others.It
had been the effect of persuasion.It had been weakness and
embarrassment.He had been very attached to her and had never seen a woman
since who he considered her equal; but other than that, of course
curiosity, he didn't feel like meeting her again.Her
the power with him was gone forever.His goal now was to get married.He was rich and excited
coast, entirely intended to settle as soon as he could be good
seduced; actually looking around, ready to fall in love with all
speed that could allow a clear head and a quick taste.He had a heart
for one of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart, in
in short, for every pleasant young woman who got in his way, except Anne
Elliot.This was his one secret exception when he said to him:
sister, in response to her assumptions:

'Yes, here I am, Sophia, all set to make a silly match.someone
between fifteen and thirty may I ask.a little beauty,
and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy, and i'm lost
Man.Shouldn't this be enough for a sailor who has had no society samenleving
among women to make him nice? "

He said it, she knew that, to be contradicted ....His bright proud eye spoke
the belief that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was not of his
thoughts, as he more seriously described the woman he would like
Meet."A strong mind, with a sweet demeanor," was the first
and the last of the description."That's the woman I want," he said...."A little bit less me
will endure of course, but it shouldn't be much.If I'm a fool
I shall indeed be a fool, for I have thought more than this subject
most men."



Chapter 8


From then on, Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly in the
the same circle.They were soon dining together in company at Mr.
Musgrove's, for the little boy's condition could no longer supply his aunt
with a pretense of missing oneself; and this was just the beginning
from other dinings and other gatherings.Whether past feelings needed to be renewed has to go to the
proof; past times must no doubt be remembered
each; they couldn't help but fall back on; the year of their engagement
could not but be mentioned by him, in the little stories or descriptions
what conversation started.His profession qualified him, his
disposition lead him to talk; and "That was in the year six;" "Which
happened before I went to sea in year six, ”took place in the course
from the first evening they spent together: and though his voice didn't...
falter, and though she had no reason to believe his eyes were wandering…
to her as he spoke, Anne felt the utter impossibility, of her
knowledge of his mind, that he could not be visited by a memory
more than herself.There must be the same immediate association of it
Thought, though she hadn't even thought it was as painful.They had no conversation with each other, no sexual intercourse but what the
most common courtesy required.Once so much for each other! Now nothing!
There had been a time when of all the great feasts now the
sitting room in Uppercross, they would have found it very difficult
no longer talk to each other.With the possible exception of Admiral
and Mrs. Croft, who seemed deeply attached and happy (Anne could
do not allow other exceptions, even among the married couples), could zou
no two hearts have been so open, no tastes so alike, no feelings like this
in unison, no faces so loved so.Now they were like strangers;
no, worse than strangers, because they could never meet.It
was a constant alienation.When he spoke, she heard the same voice and discerned the same spirit.There was a very general ignorance of all maritime affairs during the
party; and he was very questioned, and especially by the two Miss
Musgroves, who seemed to have hardly any other eyes than before him, as to the…
way of life on board, daily rules, food, hours, & c., and
their astonishment at his stories, at the level of accommodation
and arrangement that was feasible drew something pleasant from him
spot, which reminded Anne of the early days when she had been too
ignorant, and she too had been accused of assuming sailors
live on board without anything to eat, or a cook to dress it
there was either a servant to wait, or a knife and fork to use.From listening and thinking like this, she was awakened by a whisper from madam
Musgrove's who, overcome with deep regret, couldn't help but say ...

"Ah! Miss Anne, if heaven would have pleased to spare my poor son, then I dare ...
say he would have been such a different person by then."

Anne suppressed a smile and listened kindly, while Mrs. Musgrove
lit her heart a little more; and therefore for a few minutes
couldn't keep up with the others' conversation.When she was able to let her attention go back to its natural course, she said
found the Miss Musgroves who just picked up the Navy List (their own navy
list, the first ever to be in Uppercross), and sit down
together to think about it, with the purported vision to find out
ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded."Your first was the Asp, I remember; we'll look for the Asp."

"You won't find her there.Pretty worn and broken up.i was the
last man who gave birth to her.Then hardly suitable for service.Reported fit
for a year or two for home care, and so I was sent to the West
india."

The girls looked dumbfounded.'The Admiralty,' he continued, 'enjoy themselves now and then with...
send a few hundred men to sea in a ship unfit for use.But they have a lot to take care of; and among the thousands that
might as well get to the bottom if not, it's impossible for them to
distinguish the set that is least missed."

"Phoo! Phoo!" cried the admiral, "what are these young fellows talking!
Never was a better dinghy than the Asp in her day.Built for an old
dinghy, you wouldn't see her right away.Lucky guy to get her! He knows
there must have been twenty better men than he who asked for her
the same time.Lucky dude to get something so fast, no more
interested than his."

"I have felt my happiness, Admiral, I assure you;" replied Captain Wentworth,
serious.'I was as satisfied as possible with my appointment
desire.It was a great goal with me at that time to be at sea; a
very nice object, i wanted to do something."

'To make sure you did.What is a young guy like you supposed to do ashore for?
half a year together? If a man didn't have a wife, soon he wants to be
float again."

"But, Captain Wentworth," cried Louisa, "how tormented you must have been ...
when you came to the Asp to see what an old thing they had given you."

'I knew pretty well what she was for that day;' he said, smiling."I had no more discoveries to make than you would have with regard to the...
fashion and strength of every old pelisse you had seen on loan
under half your knowledge since you could remember, and which ones
finally, on a very wet day, is lent to yourself.Ah! she was a sweetheart
old Asp to me.She did everything I wanted.I knew she would.I knew
that we would either go to the bottom together, or she would be
making me; and I never had two days of bad weather
I was at sea in her; and after taking enough hijackers to be bad?
entertaining, I was lucky in my journey home the following fall,
to fill in with the very French frigate I wanted.I brought her in
Plymouth; and here's another example of happiness.We hadn't been six o'clock yet
in the Sound, when a storm rose that lasted four days and nights,
and what would have done for poor old Asp in half the time; our touch
with the Great Nation which has not improved our condition much.Twenty-four hours later, and I should have just been brave
Captain Wentworth, in a small paragraph in one corner of the
newspapers; and to be lost in just a dinghy, no one would have thought
about me."Anne's shiver was only for herself, but the Miss
Musgroves could be as open as they were sincere, in their exclamations
of pity and disgust."And so, I think," said Mrs. Musgrove in a hushed voice, as if ...
thinking out loud, 'so then he left for the Laconia, and there he met
with our poor boy.Charles, my love," (waking him up to her), "ask
Captain Wentworth where he first met your poor brother ....I
always forgotten."

'It was in Gibraltar, mother, I know.Dick was left sick on
Gibraltar, with a recommendation from its former captain to captain
Wentworth."

“Oh, but Charles, tell Captain Wentworth not to be afraid
I call poor Dick to me because that would rather be a pleasure
hear him talk through such a good friend."

Charles, who was a little more aware of the probabilities of the case,
just nodded in response and walked away.The girls were now chasing the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth could ...
do not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume in his
own hands to save them the trouble, and read the little one again
statement of her name and rate, and current free class,
while I remarked about it that she too had been one of the best friends man
ever had."Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia! How did I make it
money in her.A friend of mine and I had such a wonderful cruise together
for the western islands.Poor Harville, sister! Do you know how much he
wanted money: worse than me.He had a wife.Excellent guy.I
will never forget his happiness.He felt it all, so much for her
rice wine.I wished him again the following summer, when I was still…
the same happiness in the Mediterranean."

"And I'm sure sir," said Mrs. Musgrove, "it was a lucky day for us,
when you were put on that ship as captain.We will never forget what
you did."

Her feelings made her talk low; and Captain Wentworth, who belonged only inside
part, and probably he doesn't have Dick Musgrove on his mind at all,
looked quite tense, and as if he was waiting for more."My brother," one of the girls whispered; "mom thinks of poor"
Richard."

"Poor dear fellow!" continued Mrs. Musgrove; "he had grown so steadily,
and such an excellent correspondent, while in your charge! Ah!
it would have been a joy if he never left you.I assure
you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry that he ever left you."

There was a momentary look on Captain Wentworth's face at this
speech, a certain look of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome
mouth, which convinced Anne that instead of sharing in Ms. Musgrove's ...
kind wishes, as for her son, he probably had made an effort to
away from him; but it was too fleeting indulgence in self-entertainment
being noticed by anyone who understood him less than she herself; in another
moment he was perfectly collected and serious, and almost immediately
then come to the bench on which she and Mrs Musgrove sat
seated, took a seat with the latter, and struck up a conversation with
her, in a soft voice, about her son, and did it with such sympathy and...
natural grace, as shown by the kindest consideration for all that was
real and uncomfortable in the feelings of the parents.They were actually on the same couch, because Mrs. Musgrove would have liked it
gave way to him; they were only shared by Mrs Musgrove.It was no
insignificant barrier, indeed.Mrs. Musgrove was of a comfortable,
substantial size, infinitely more fit in nature to express the good
cheerfulness and good humor, then tenderness and sentiment; and while the
agitations of Anne's slender shape and thoughtful face can be considered
as very fully screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some
honor for the self-control with which he tended to her great fat
sighs over the fate of a son, whom no one had yet taken care of.Personal size and spiritual sorrow are certainly not necessary
proportions.A large voluminous figure is just as entitled to be deep
condition, as the most graceful set of limbs in the world.But honestly
or not fair, there are inappropriate conjunctions, what reason will
patronize in vain - which taste cannot bear - which mockery will zal
seize.The Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns around the room
with his hands behind him, called to order by his wife, now came
to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation of what he might be ...
interrupt, thinking only of his own thoughts, began with--

"If you had been in Lisbon a week later last spring, Frederick, you would...
would have been asked to give a pass to Lady Mary Grierson and her
daughters."

'Must I? I'm glad I wasn't a week later then."

The admiral abused him for his lack of courage.He defended himself;
although he claimed he would never willingly admit ladies
board a ship of his, except for a ball, or a visit that a couple
hours.'But if I know myself,' he said, 'it is not a lack of bravery
to them.Rather it is by feeling how impossible it is, with everyone
one's efforts, and all one's sacrifices, to make the accommodation
governance as women should have.There can be no lack of bravery,
Admiral, who values ​​women's claims to every personal comfort,
and this is what i do.I hate to hear or see from women on board
them on board; and no ship under my command will ever carry a family
from ladies everywhere, if I can help it."

This brought his sister to him."Oh! Frederick! But I can't believe you.- All inactive
sophistication!--Women may feel as comfortable on board as in the best home
in England.I believe I have lived on board as much as most women, and
I know nothing better than accommodation on a warship.I
declare that I have no comfort or indulgence over me, even with
Kellynch Hall, "(with a friendly bow to Anne)," beyond what I always had in it
most of the ships I've lived in; and they've been five in all."

"No point," replied her brother."You lived with
your husband, and were the only woman on board."

'But you yourself have Mrs. Harville, her sister, her cousin and
three children, from Portsmouth to Plymouth.Where was this
super fine, extraordinary bravery of yours? "

'All melted into my friendship, Sophia.I would help any brother
officer's wife that I could, and I would take everything from Harville's...
from the end of the world, if he wanted it.But don't imagine I did
don't feel it as an evil in itself."

'Deal with it, they were all perfectly at ease."

'I may not like them, so much the better for that maybe.such a number
women and children have no right to comfort on board."

'My dear Frederick, you talk rather idly.Pray what would
become of us poor sailors wives, who often want to be handed over to one
postage or another, after our husbands, if everyone had your feelings? '

"You see, my feelings didn't stop me from taking Mrs. Harville and stuff."
her family to Plymouth."

"But I hate to hear you talk like this like a fine gentleman, and like ...
women were all fine ladies, rather than rational beings.none of us
we expect to be in smooth water all our days."

“Oh, my dear,” said the admiral, “if he had a wife, he'll sing
another tune.If he's married, if we're lucky enough to be alive
to another war, we'll see him do like you and me, and a great many
others, have done.We will be very grateful to him for that
will bring him his wife."

"Yes we will."

"Now I've done it," cried Captain Wentworth.'When was once married to people
start attacking me with: - 'Oh! you will think very differently when
you are married."All I can say is, 'No, I won't; ' and then they say
again: 'Yes, you will', and it will come to an end."

He got up and walked away."What a wonderful traveler you must have been, ma'am!" said Mrs Musgrove
to Mrs. Croft."Pretty good, ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage, although a lot ...
women have done more.I crossed the Atlantic four times and I did
been to the East Indies once, and back again, and only once; besides
at various places in the house are: Cork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar.But I never went beyond the Streights and was never in the West
india.We don't call Bermuda or Bahama, you know, West Indies."

Mrs. Musgrove had not a word to argue; she couldn't blame it
ever calling herself of them anything in the course of her
life."And I assure you, madam," continued Mrs. Croft, "nothing can...
surpass the modifications of a warship; I speak, you know, of the
higher rates.When you come to a frigate, of course you are more
limited; although any reasonable woman can be perfectly happy in any one of them
them; and I can safely say it has been the happiest part of my life
spent on board a ship.While we were together, you know, there was
nothing to fear.Thank God! I have always been blessed with
excellent health, and no climate disagree.A little
always disorderly the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but
never knew what sickness was next.The only time I'm ever real
suffered in body or mind, the only time I've ever imagined myself
unwell, or had any sense of danger, was the winter I passed
myself at Deal, when the admiral (then Captain Croft) was up north
seas.At that time I lived in constant fear and had all kinds of things
imaginary complaints because I didn't know what to do with myself, or when I should
should hear the following from him; but as long as we could be together, nothing
ever hurt me, and never had the slightest discomfort."

"Yeah, just to be sure.Yes, indeed, oh yes! I'm all your mind,
Mrs. Croft, ”was Mrs. Musgrove's cordial reply."There is nothing so bad
like a divorce.I totally agree with you.I know what it is for
Mr. Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I'm so happy when they are
over, and he's safe again."

The evening ended with dancing.When it was proposed, Anne offered
its services, as usual; and though her eyes sometimes filled with
tears while sitting at the instrument, she was extremely happy about that
employed, and wanted nothing in return but not to be noticed opgemerkt.It was a merry, merry party, and no one seemed more cheerful than…
Captain Wentworth.She felt he had everything to lift him up
what general attention and reverence, and especially the attention of
all young women could do.The Miss Hayters, the females of the
relatives of the cousins ​​mentioned above, were apparently admitted to the
honor to be in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa, she
both seemed so completely occupied by him that nothing but it went on
semblance of the most perfect benevolence could have between themselves
made it believable that they were not determined rivals.If he's a
little spoiled by such universal, such eager admiration, who would ...
wonder?

These were some of the thoughts that occupied Anne while her fingers
working mechanically, working together for half an hour,
without mistakes and without consciousness.Once she felt that
he looked at himself, perhaps observing her altered features,
try to trace in them the ruins of the face that once charmed
him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her; she was barely
aware of it, until she heard the answer; but then she was sure of his
asked his partner if Miss Elliot never danced? The answer
was, "Oh no; never; she has given up dancing completely.She would have preferred
Play.She never gets tired of playing.He also spoke to her once.She had left the instrument on the dancing creature and he had sat down
down to try to make out a scent that he wanted to give the Miss
Musgroves an idea from.She unintentionally returned to that part of the
room; he saw her, immediately got up and said with studied politeness:

'Excuse me, ma'am, this is your seat;' and although they
immediately withdrew with a decided negative, he was not to be induced
sit down again.Anne did not want more of such looks and speeches.His cold
politeness, his solemn grace, were worse than anything else.Chapter 9


Captain Wentworth had come to Kellynch for a house, to stay as long as...
he liked, because he was just as thoroughly the object of the admiral's fraternal
kindness as of his wife.He intended, on his first arrival, to
very soon go to Shropshire and visit the brother who settled there
that country, but Uppercross's appeal led him to say this:
from.There was so much kindness and flattery and things
everything most enchanting in its reception there; the old ones were like this
hospitable, the young so pleasant that he could not help but decide to
stay where he was, and take all the charms and perfections of
Edward's wife on credit a little longer.Soon it was Uppercross with him almost every day.The Musgroves can
hardly more ready to invite than he to perish, especially in the
morning, when he had no companion at home, for the admiral and madam
Croft was generally outside together, interested in himself
their new possessions, their grasses and their sheep, and wandering
in a way that is not bearable for a third person, or driving off during a performance,
recently added to their branch.Until now there had been only one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the...
Musgroves and their dependencies.It was an unchanging, warm admiration
everywhere; but this intimate base was no more than established,
when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them, to be a good deal
disturbed by it, and to think very much in the way of Captain Wentworth.Charles Hayter was the eldest of all cousins ​​and a very amiable,
pleasant young man, between whom and Henrietta had been one
considerable semblance of attachment prior to that of Captain Wentworth
introduction.He had orders; and having a curation in the
neighborhood, where no place of residence was required, lived with his father
house, just two miles from Uppercross.Had a brief absence from home
left his beautiful beauty unguarded by his attention during this critical period,
and when he came back he had the pain of finding very different ways,
and to see Captain Wentworth.Mrs. Musgrove and Mrs. Hayter were sisters.They all had money, but
their marriages had made a substantial difference in their degree of
consequence.Mr Hayter had his own belongings, but that was about it
insignificant compared to that of Mr. Musgrove; and while the Musgroves were
in the first class of society in the country, the young Hayters,
of their parents' inferior, retired and unpolished way of life,
and their own lack of education, have hardly been in a class
all except for their connection to Uppercross, this eldest son of course
except, who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was
very superior in cultivation and manners to the rest.The two families had always had excellent conditions, there was none
pride on the one hand, and no envy on the other, and only such a
awareness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as she made
happy to improve their cousins.Charles' Attention to Henrietta
was observed without any disapproval from her father and mother."It wouldn't be a good match for her; but if Henrietta liked him," -
and Henrietta seemed to like him.Henrietta herself felt the same way before Captain Wentworth came; but
from that time on, Cousin Charles had been very forgotten.Which of the two sisters Captain Wentworth preferred was still?
rather doubtful, as far as Anne's observation went.Henrietta was
perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits; and she didn't know
now, whether the softer or the more lively character was the most
probably to put him on.Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove, either by seeing little or by a whole
confidence in the discretion of their two daughters, and of all
young men who came near them seemed to leave everything behind to take it
opportunity.There was not the hint of concern or comment
about them in the mansion; but at The Cottage it was different:
the young couple there were more prone to speculation and wonder; and
Captain Wentworth hadn't been four or five times higher than in the Miss
The company of Musgroves and Charles Hayter had only just reappeared when
Anne had to listen to her brother and sister's opinion regarding:
which one was the best.Charles gave it for Louisa, for Mary
Henrietta, but totally agreed it could be him too
extremely delicious.Charles' had never seen a nicer man in his life, and what he did
Captain Wentworth had once heard himself say, he was very sure he had
earned by the war no less than twenty thousand pounds.Here was one
fortune at once; in addition, there would be the chance of what could be
be done in a future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was the same
probably a man distinguished as an officer in the navy.Oh! it
would be a grand prize for one of his sisters."

"On my word it would happen," replied Mary."Dear me! If he got up
a great honor! If he ever became a baron! 'Lady
Wentworth' sounds really good.That would be a noble thing indeed, because
Henrietta! She would then take a seat in front of me, and Henrietta would not
don't like that.Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth! It would just be a new one
creation however, and I never think much about your new creations."

It suited Mary best to think that Henrietta was the one who actually preferred ...
report by Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished to see one
ending on.She looked down on the Hayters with determination and thought
it would be quite an accident to have the existing connection between
the families have been renewed - very sad for herself and her children."You know," she said, "I don't think he's suitable for...
Henrietta; and given the alliances the Musgroves have made,
she has no right to throw herself away.I am not thinking of a young woman
has the right to make a choice that can be unpleasant and inconvenient
to most of her family, and impart bad connections
those who are not used to it.And, pray, who is Charles
Hayter? Nothing but a country captain.A most inappropriate match for Miss
Musgrove from Uppercross."

Her husband, however, would disagree with her here; for in addition to having
respect for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son, and he saw...
things like an eldest son himself.'Now you are talking nonsense, Mary', was therefore his answer."It
wouldn't be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has a very fair one
chance, through the Spicers, to get something from the bishop ...
over the course of a year or two; and you will please remember that he
is the eldest son; everytime my uncle dies he steps in very nice
property.The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and
fifty acres, next to the farm near Taunton, which is one of the best?
country in the country.I admit that any of them except Charles would
be a very shocking match for Henrietta, and indeed it couldn't be; he
is the only one that could be possible; but he is very good-natured,
good kind of guy; and whenever Winthrop gets into his hands, he
will make it a different kind of place, and go into a whole different life
kind of way; and with that possession he will never be contemptible
man - well, owned owned.No no; Henrietta could do worse than that
marry Charles Hayter; and if she has it, Louisa can get captain
Wentworth, I will be very satisfied."

'Charles can say what he likes,' Mary called to Anne, as soon as he
was out of the room, 'but it would be shocking to have Henrietta married
Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and worse for me; and
therefore it is very desirable that Captain Wentworth may soon
pretty much put him out of her mind, and I have no doubt that he
has.She barely paid attention to Charles Hayter yesterday.if i want
you had been there to see her behavior.And as for Captain Wentworth's
Like Louisa and Henrietta, it is nonsense to say so; for him
certainly loves Henrietta a lot.But Charles is so
positive! I wish you'd been with us yesterday because then you could
have decided between us; and I'm sure you would have thought like I did,
unless you were determined to take on me."

Dinner at Mr. Musgrove's had been the occasion for all these things
should have been seen by Anne; but she had stayed home, under the...
mixed plea for her own headache, and some recurrence of periods
in little Charles.She had only thought of avoiding Captain Wentworth;
but an escape to appeal to the referee was now added to the
benefits of a quiet evening.As to Captain Wentworth's views, she considered it more important than that
he must know his own mind early enough to get the
happiness of either sister, or the deposition of his own honor, than he ...
would prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.Either
they would in all likelihood make him a clingy, good-humored
woman.Regarding Charles Hayter, she had a delicacy that must be
haunted by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman, and a
heart to sympathize with each of the sufferings it caused; but if
Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings, the
change could not be understood too quickly.Charles Hayter had been through a lot to upset and torment him in his
cousin behavior.She had too old a face for him to be so complete
alienated as possible in two encounters every hope of the past extinguishes, and
leave him nothing to do but stay away from Uppercross: but there
was such a change that it became very alarming, when such a man as a captain ...
Wentworth was to be considered the likely cause.He had been absent
only two Sundays, and when they parted, had even left her interested…
to the height of his desires, in anticipation of soon ceasing his...
current curation, and get Uppercross's instead.It had then
seemed the object closest to her heart, that Dr. Shirley, the headmaster, who
had diligently fulfilled all duties for more than 40 years
of office, but now became too weak for many of them, should
be rather focused on hiring a chaplain; should make his curation like this
as best he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of ...
it.The advantage that he only has to come to Uppercross, instead of…
go six miles in a different way; that he is better in every way
curation; of his property of their dear Dr. Shirley, and from dear, good Dr.
Shirley is relieved of the duty he could no longer get
through without the most damaging fatigue, would have been a lot, even to
Louisa, but Henrietta had meant almost everything.When he came
back, unfortunately! the company's zeal was over.Louisa couldn't
just listen to his report of a conversation he just had
with Dr. Shirley: she was standing in front of a window looking out for the captain
Wentworth; and even Henrietta had at most divided attention to it
and seemed to have forgotten all previous doubts and anxieties
of the negotiation.'Well, I'm very glad indeed: but I always thought you'd have it;
I always thought you were sure.It didn't occur to me - in short, you
You know, Dr. Shirley must have a chaplain, and you would have made sure of his promise.Is he coming, Louisa?"

One morning, very soon after dinner at the Musgroves, where Anne
had not been present, Captain Wentworth entered the saloon to…
the Cottage, where only she and the little invalid Charles were,
who was lying on the couch.The surprise that he was almost alone with Anne Elliot, robbed
his manners of their usual calm: he started, and could only say:
'I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here: Mrs Musgrove told me it was me
should find them here, ”before he walked to the window to remember
himself, and feel how he should behave."They are up the stairs with my sister: they will be down in a few minutes
moments, dare I say," had been Anne's reply, in all the confusion that…
was of course; and if the child had not called her to come and do it
something for him, she would have been out of the room the next moment,
and released both Captain Wentworth and himself.He continued to the window; and after I calmly and politely said, "I
hope the little boy is better, 'shut up.She had to kneel by the couch and stay there to satisfy
her patient; and so they went on for a few minutes, then, to her very ...
great satisfaction, she heard another person cross the little one
vestibule.When she turned her head, she hoped the master of the ...
House; but it turned out to be one much less suited to making things
easy - Charles Hayter, probably not at all happy with the sight
of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been at the sight of
Anne.She was just trying to say, 'How are you? Don't you want to sit down?
others will be here soon."

Captain Wentworth came out his window though, apparently not
bad in conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to it
his attempts by sitting at the table and the
newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.Another minute brought another addition.The younger boy, a remarkable one
sturdy, progressive child, of two years old, for whom the door is open
him by someone from without, made his firm appearance among them, and
went straight to the bank to see what was going on and stopped being
to lay claim to something good that may give away.Since there was nothing to eat, he could only play a little; and as are
Auntie didn't let him tease his sick brother, he started tying up
knelt down on her in such a way that busy as she was ...
about Charles, she couldn't shake him off.She spoke to him, ordered,
begged and urged in vain.Once she had managed to push him. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
gone, but the boy had the greatest pleasure in crawling on her back
again immediately.“Walter,” she said, “come on down.you are extreme
difficult.I am very angry with you."

"Walter," cried Charles Hayter, "why don't you do as you are asked?
can't you hear your aunt speak? Come to me, Walter, come to cousin
Charles."

But Walter didn't move a little.At another time, however, she found herself in the state of being
delivered from him; someone took it from her, though he had bowed
so far down that his little firm hands loosened
from around her neck, and he was resolutely carried away before she knew it...
that Captain Wentworth had done it.Her feelings at the discovery left her completely speechless.They
couldn't even thank him.She could only hang over little Charles,
with the most disordered feelings.His kindness to approach her
relief, the way, the silence in which it had passed, the little one
details of the circumstance, with the conviction soon forced upon her
by the noise he zealously made with the child, which he meant...
avoid hearing her thanks, and rather endeavor to testify that she
conversation was the last of his wishes, caused such confusion
varying but very painful excitement, from which she could not recover,
made possible by making the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves
about her little patient to their concerns, and leave the room.she could
don't stay.It might have been an opportunity to look at the loves and
jealousy of the four - they were all now; but she could stay
for none of it.It was clear that Charles Hayter was not well
inclined to Captain Wentworth.She had a strong impression of him
that said, in a mean tone, after Captain Wentworth's...
meddling: "You should have watched me, Walter; I told you not to...
teaze your aunt; 'and could understand that he was sorry about that captain
Wentworth should do what he should have done himself.But neither
Charles Hayter's feelings, nor anyone else's feelings, could interest her,
until she had arranged her own something better.She was ashamed of it
herself, very ashamed to be so nervous, so overcome by such one
trifle; but so it was, and it took a long application of solitude
and reflection to restore it.Chapter 10


Other opportunities to make her observations were inevitable.Soon Anne was in company often enough with all four of them
to have an opinion, though too wise to admit so much at home,
where she knew it would have pleased neither man nor woman; in front of
while she found Louisa the favorite before, she couldn't
but think, as far as she would dare to judge from the head and
experience, which Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.They
were more in love with him; but there it was no love.It was a bit
fever of admiration; but it can, probably should, end in love with
some.Charles Hayter seemed to be consciously belittled, and yet Henrietta
sometimes had the impression of being divided between them.Anne longed for
the power to represent to them everything they were about, and from
pointing out some of the evil they exposed themselves to.They
did not attribute deception to anyone.It was the greatest satisfaction for her
to believe that Captain Wentworth was not in the least aware of the pain he was feeling ...
occasion.There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph in his way.He probably had never heard anything and never thought of any claim
Charles Hayter.He was only wrong in accepting the attentions (for
accept must be the word) of two young women at the same time.However, after a brief struggle, Charles Hayter seemed to quit the ...
field.Three days had passed without him ever coming to Uppercross; a
most decided change.He had even declined a regular invitation
supper; and found on the occasion by Mr. Musgrove with some ...
big books for him, Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove were sure that not everyone could be
right, speaking earnestly about his study of himself to death.It was Mary's hope and belief that he'd been positively fired
Henrietta's, and her husband lived under constant dependence on it
see him tomorrow.Anne could only feel that Charles was Hayter
wise.One morning, this time around Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworthnt
go shoot together, like the sisters were in the Cottage...
sitting quietly at work, the sisters visited them at the window
of the mansion.It was a very beautiful November day and the Miss Musgroves came through
the small grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say so
they went for a long walk, so they concluded that Mary could
don't like to go with them; and when Mary answered immediately, with what ...
jealousy because you are not supposed to be a good walker: 'Oh yes, I would like that
to go with you very much, I love a long walk; 'felt Anne
convinced, by the looks of the two girls, that it was exactly what
they didn't want to, and again admired the kind of necessity that the
family habits seemed to produce everything that would be
communicated, and everything must be done together, however
unwanted and troublesome.She tried to stop Mary from going, but ...
in vain; and if that was the case I thought it was best to accept the missus
Musgroves' much heartier invitation to himself to go too, if
she could be helpful to return with her sister and reduce the
interference in their own plan.'I can't imagine why they would think I wouldn't want long
walk, ”said Mary, climbing the stairs."Everyone is always there
suppose I am not a good walker; and yet they wouldn't have been
satisfied, if we had refused to join them.When people get in here
way of asking us, how can anyone say no? "

Just as they left, the gentlemen came back.they had taken
from a young dog, who had spoiled their sport, and sent them back early.Their time and power, and spirits, was therefore exactly ready
for this walk, and they went in with pleasure.Could Anne be?
if she had foreseen such a cross, she would have stayed home; but, some
feelings of interest and curiosity, she now imagined it was too
late to retreat, and the whole six went forward together in the
direction chosen by Miss Musgroves, apparently the
walk as under their guidance.Anne's goal was not to get in anyone's way; and where the
narrow paths across the fields made many divisions necessary to maintain
with her brother and sister.Her pleasure in the walk should come from:
the exercise and the day, given the last smile of the year
on the yellow-brown leaves and withered hedges, and from repeating to
even some of the thousands of poetic descriptions that still exist
autumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind
of taste and tenderness, that season that had drawn from every poet,
worthy of being read, an attempt at description or a few lines
feeling.She kept herself busy with such things as much as possible
musings and quotes; but it was not possible that when it was within reach
from Captain Wentworth's conversation with one of the Miss Musgroves,
she shouldn't try to hear it; yet she caught little remarkable opmerkelijk.It was merely a lively chat, like all young people, in an intimate way
foot, could fall into it.He was more concerned with Louisa than with
Henrietta.Louisa has certainly put forward more for his notice than her
sister.This distinction seemed to increase, and there was one
speech of Louisa that struck her.After one of the many praises from
the day, which erupted constantly, Captain Wentworth...
added: -

'What glorious weather for the admiral and my sister! They wanted that
take a long drive this morning; maybe we can get them from some
these hills.They were talking about coming to this side of the country.I
wonder where they will get upset today.Oh! it happens a lot
often, I assure you; but my sister doesn't make any of it; she would be
be discarded as not."

'Ah! You get the best of it, I know, "cried Louisa," but if you were
I really should do the same in her place.If I loved a man
since she loves the admiral I would always be with him, nothing should zou
ever separate us, and I would rather be overthrown by him than driven
safely by someone else."

People spoke with enthusiasm."Did you have?" he cried, holding the same tone; "I honor you!" And there
it was quiet between them for a while.Anne could not immediately submit an offer again.The candy
scenes of the fall were put off for a while, unless a tender sonnet,
laden with the appropriate analogy of the falling year, with the falling year
happiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone
together, blessed her memory.She woke herself up to say, like she ...
beaten by the order on a different path: "Isn't this one of the ways to
Winthrop? ”But no one heard, or at least no one answered her.Winthrop, however, or his entourage - for young men sometimes it is
meeting, strolling around home - was their destination; and after that
another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures, where the
plowing at work, and the freshly made path contradicted the farmer
the sweets of poetic despondency, and the desire to have spring again,
they reached the top of the most significant hill, which parted
Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon got a full view of the latter,
at the bottom of the hill on the other side.Winthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them;
an indifferent house, low standing, enclosed by the barns and
buildings of a barnyard.Mary exclaimed, "Bless me! Here is Winthrop.I declare that I had no idea!
Well, I think we'd better turn back; I am extremely tired."

Henrietta, conscious and ashamed, not seeing a cousin Charles walking
along any path, or leaning against a gate, was ready to act like Mary
desirable; but no! "said Charles Musgrove, and" No, no! "cried Louisa
more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to discuss the
to be important.Meanwhile, Charles most decidedly declared his resolution
to visit his aunt, now that he was so close; and very clearly,
though more terrifying, trying to persuade his wife to go too.But this
was one of the points where the lady showed her strength; and when
he recommended the advantage of resting for a quarter of an hour
Winthrop, feeling so tired, answered firmly, "Oh! No,
indeed! walking up that hill again would hurt her more than anyone else
sitting can do her good; and, in short, her looks and demeanor
stated, she wouldn't.After a short succession of these kinds of debates and consultations,
it was arranged between Charles and his two sisters that he and
Henrietta should only have to run downstairs for a few minutes to see their aunt and...
cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the
hill.Louisa seemed to be the main editor of the plan; and, like them
went with them for a bit, down the hill, still talking to Henrietta,
Mary took the opportunity to look around disdainfully and said:
to Captain Wentworth--

'It is very unpleasant to have such connections! But, I assure you, I
have never been to the house above twice in my life."

She got no answer but an artificial, approving smile,
followed by a scornful look as he turned away, that Anne
perfectly knew the meaning of.The top of the hill, where they stayed, was a happy place: Louisa
returned; and Mary, who found herself a comfortable seat on the step
of a style, was very pleased as long as the others were all standing
about her; but when Louisa withdrew Captain Wentworth, to try for one
nuts gather in an adjoining hedge, and they were over
degrees completely out of sight and sound, Mary was no longer happy; they
had a fight with her own chair, was sure Louisa had gotten a lot better
somewhere, and nothing could stop her from looking for a
better too.She walked through the same gate, but couldn't see it.Anne found a nice seat for her, on a dry sunny bank, under the
row of hedges, in which she had no doubt that they were still there, somewhere
or other.Mary sat down for a moment, but it didn't work; she was
sure Louisa would have found a better seat elsewhere, and she would continue
until she caught up with her.Anne, who was also very tired herself, was happy to sit down; and they very quickly
heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge behind her, as if ...
finding their way back along the rugged, wild kind of canal, the
Centre.They spoke as they approached.Louisa's voice was the
distinguished for the first time.She seemed to be in the middle of an eagerness
speech.What Anne first heard was…

"And so I let her go.I couldn't bear that she would be scared
of the visit by such nonsense.What! would I be bounced from?
do something that I decided to do that I knew was right,
through the air and interference from such a person, or from anyone else
say? No, I have no idea I can be persuaded so easily.When I have
made my decision, I made it; and Henrietta seemed to have it all
made hers to go to Winthrop today; and yet she was so close
giving up, out of nonsensical complacency! "

"She would have returned then, but for you?"

“Indeed she would.I'm almost ashamed to say it."

"Happy for her, to have a ghost like yours at hand! After the hints
you just gave, which only confirmed my own observations, the last one
time when I was in company with him, I don't have to influence to have no
understanding of what's going on.I see that more than just dutifully
morning visit to your aunt was in question; and woe betide him and her
also when it comes to important things, when they are placed in it
circumstances that require steadfastness and strength of mind, if she hasn't
resolution enough to withstand idle interference in such a trifle as this one.Your sister is a lovely creature; but yours is the character of
determination and determination, I see.If you value her behavior or happiness,
pour as much of your own mind into her as you can.But this, no
doubt, you've always done it.It's also the worst evil
an indulgent and indecisive character that cannot be influenced
depended on.You can never be sure that a good impression will last;
anyone can influence it.Let those who are happy be steadfast.Here is
a note," he said, catching one from an upper branch, "to illustrate:
a beautiful glossy note, which, blessed with original strength,
survived all the storms of autumn.No flat tyre, no weak spot
everywhere.This note, "he continued, playfully solemnly," when it was
many of his brothers have fallen and trampled underfoot, is silent
possessing all the luck that a hazelnut can be imagined
capable of.’ Then he returned to his former serious tone: ‘My first…
wish for everyone I'm interested in is that they should be solid.if
Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life,
she will nurture all of her current thinking ability."

He had done it and was unanswered.It would have surprised Anne if
Louisa could have easily answered such a speech: such words
interest, spoken with such serious warmth! She could imagine what
Louisa felt.For herself she was afraid to move, otherwise she would have to
being seen.While she stayed, a bush sheltered low creeping holly
her, and they went on.Before they were out of her ear,
Louisa spoke again."Mary is good-natured enough in many ways," she said; "but she does"
sometimes provokes me excessively by her nonsense and pride - the Elliot
pride.She's got way too much of the Elliot pride.Let's do that
wish Charles had married Anne instead.I suppose you know him
want to marry Anne?"

After a short silence, Captain Wentworth said:

"You mean she refused him?"

"Oh! Yes; sure."

"When did that happen?"

"I don't know exactly, because Henrietta and I were at school at the time;
but I believe about a year before he married Mary.I wish she had done it
accepted him.We should all have liked her a lot more; and
Mom and Dad always think it was her good friend Lady Russell's
do, she didn't.They think maybe Charles wasn't learned and...
bookish enough to please Lady Russell, and that's why she
persuaded Anne to refuse him."

The sounds receded and Anne was no longer discerning.Her own
emotions still kept her fixated.She had a lot to recover from before
she could move.The listener's proverbial fate was not absolute
her; she had heard no harm from herself, but she had heard a lot
of very painful significance.She saw how her own character was viewed
by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree of feeling
and curiosity about her in his way that must give her extreme
agitation.As soon as she could, she went after Maria, found her, and walked
back with her to their former station, at the transfer, felt some comfort
in all their company immediately afterwards, and once
moving more together.Her spirits wanted solitude and silence
who could only give numbers.Charles and Henrietta returned and, it is believed,
Charles Hayter with them.Anne couldn't get the details of the company
trying to understand; even Captain Wentworth didn't seem to admit it
perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawal on the
men's lace, and a lady's forgiveness, and now they were
very happy to be together again, admitted no doubt.Henrietta
looked a little embarrassed, but very pleased; - Charles Hayter
extremely happy: and they were devoted to each other almost from the start
first moment of their all forward for Uppercross.Everything now marked Louisa for Captain Wentworth; nothing could
be clearer; and where many divisions were needed, or even where they were
were not, they ran side by side almost as much as the other two.In
a long strip of meadow, where there was enough space for everyone
were thus divided and formed three different parties; and to that party of
the three with the least enthusiasm and the least complacency, Anne
necessarily belonged.She joined Charles and Mary and was tired
enough to be very happy with Charles's other arm; but Charles, though in
very good humored with her, was not good in his own skin.Mary had
disobeyed him, and would now reap the consequences,
with the result that almost every moment he dropped her arm to cut
of the heads of some nettles in the hedge with its switch; and when
Mary started to complain about it and regretted being used poorly, according to ...
as usual, because she was on the side of the hedge, while Anne was never incommode
on the other hand he dropped the arms of both to hunt a weasel that ...
he glanced at it, and they could hardly get him to it
all.This long meadow bordered an avenue, whose footpath, at the end of it
it was to cross, and when the party reached the gate of the exit,
the carriage was heading in the same direction, which had been a while ago
heard, just arrived and turned out to be Admiral Croft's gig.He
and his wife had taken their intended ride and were on their way home.When they heard how long a walk the young people had taken, they came
kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired; it
would save her a whole mile, and they went through Uppercross.The invitation was general and was generally declined.The Miss Musgroves
were not tired at all, and Mary was also offended for not being asked about it
for one of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride, could...
can't bear to make a third in a one horse chaise.The walking party had crossed the track and climbed a
opposite style, and the admiral set his horse in motion again,
when Captain Wentworth rushed through the hedge in the blink of an eye to say something
to his sister.It something can be guessed by its effects."Miss Elliot, I'm sure you're tired," called Mrs. Croft."Let us
the pleasure of taking you home.There is great space for this
three, I assure you.If we were all like you I believe we could sit
four.You must, indeed, you must."

Anne was still in the job; and though instinctively begin to ...
refuse, she was not allowed to continue.The admiral's kind urgency
came to support his wife; they would not be refused; they
compressed into the smallest possible space to give its a
corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word, turned to her,
and quietly forced her to be helped into the carriage.Yes; he had done it.She was in the carriage and felt him ...
put her there, that his will and his hands had done it, that she
it owes to his perception of her fatigue and his decision to give
her rest.She was very touched by the view of his character
to her, which made all these things clear.this little one
circumstance seemed the completion of all that had preceded it.They
understood him.He couldn't forgive her, but he couldn't be
numb.Although she condemns her for the past, and considers it with ...
high and unjust resentment, though utterly imprudent of her, and
though he became attached to another, yet he could not see her suffer,
without the desire to give her relief.It was a remnant of the past
sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unrecognized, friendship;
it was proof of his own warm and lovable heart, which she could not
contemplating without emotions so composed of pleasure and pain, that
she didn't know which one prevailed.Her responses to the kindness and comments of her companions were on
first unconsciously given.They were halfway through the
rough track, before she was completely awake from what they were saying.She then
she liked talking about "Frederick."

"He definitely wants one of those two girls, Sofie,"
said the admiral; "but it is impossible to say which one".He is running
also after them, long enough, you would think, to come to a decision.Yes, this comes from the rest.If it was war now, he would have settled
it long ago.We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to stay long
wartime courtship.How many days was it, my love, between the
the first time i saw you and we sat down together
shelter in North Yarmouth? "

"We better not talk about it, my love," replied Mrs. Croft,
pleasant; "because if Miss Elliot heard how quickly we got to a ...
understanding, she would never be convinced that we could be happy
together.However, I knew you long before that by character."

"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we...
to wait anyway? I don't like to hold such things in my hand for so long.I wish Frederick would spread some more canvas and take us home
one of these young ladies for Kellynch.Then there would always be
company for them.And very nice young ladies they both are; I hardly
know one of the other."

"Very good-humored, unaffected girls, indeed," said Mrs. Croft in a ...
tone of calmer praise, as Anne suggested her sharper powers
she could consider neither of them worthy of her brother; "and
a very respectable family.One could not be connected with better
people.My dear admiral, that post! we will take that for sure
post."

Fortunately, however, by giving the reins a better direction themselves, they are happy
beyond the danger; and by judiciously extinguishing her afterwards
hand they did not fall into a rut, nor did they walk through a dung cart; and
Anne, with some amusement at their driving, which she imagined
not a bad representation of the general management of their affairs, found
deposited themselves safely by them at the Cottage.Chapter 11


The time was now approaching for Lady Russell's return: the day was the same
made; and Anne, engaged to join her as soon as she got there
resettled, looked forward to an early move to Kellynch, and
began to consider how her own comfort would probably be affected by it.It would put her in the same village as Captain Wentworth in there
half a mile from him; they should attend the same church, and
there must be intercourse between the two families.This was against
her; but on the other hand he spent so much time in Uppercross,
that if she went away from there, she might rather be regarded as leaving him hem
behind, then as to go to him; and generally she believed...
she must, on this interesting question, be the winner, almost like...
certainly as with her change of domestic society, with poor Mary's abandonment
for Lady Russell.She wished it was possible she would never see the captain
Wentworth at the Hall: Those rooms had witnessed previous gatherings
would be too painful for her; but she was even more scared
for the possibility that Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meet?
everywhere.They didn't love each other, and they didn't get to know each other again
could do some good now; and was Lady Russell to see them together, she
might think he had too much self-control and she too little.These points were her main concern in anticipating her removal
from Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed for a long time
enough.Her usefulness to little Charles would always pay off
sweetness to the memory of her two month visit there, but he was
gained momentum quickly, and she had nothing else to stay ahead of.However, the conclusion of her visit was diverse in a way
she hadn't thought it at all.Captain Wentworth, after being unseen and
unheard of in Uppercross for two days, reappeared among them
to justify himself by a relationship with what had kept him away.A letter from his friend, Captain Harville, who discovered him on ...
recently, had brought information about the settlement of Captain Harville
his family in Lyme for the winter; therefore free from their being
unconsciously, within twenty miles of each other.Captain Harville had
never been in good health since a serious wound he sustained two
years before, and had determined Captain Wentworth's fear of seeing him
him to go to Lyme immediately.He was already twenty-four
hour.His acquittal was complete, his friendship heartily honoured, and
keen interest in his friend, and his description of the fine
country about Lyme so with feeling attended by the party, that one
sincere desire to see Lyme for yourself, and a project to go there
was the result.The young people were all wild to see Lyme.Captain Wentworth spoke
to go there again myself, it was only seventeen miles from
upper cross; in November the weather was certainly not bad; and in
in short, Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager to form the
decides to go, and besides having the pleasure of doing what she wanted,
now armed with the idea of ​​merit in maintaining its own path, it drowned
all the wishes of her father and mother to postpone it until summer;
and to Lyme they would go - Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta, Louisa,
and Captain Wentworth.The first careless plan had been to go in the morning and return to
night; but Mr. Musgrove would not do this for the sake of his horses
permission; and when it had to be considered rationally, a day in the
in mid-November there wouldn't be much time left to see a new place,
after deduction of seven hours, according to the nature of the country, for
go and return.They had to spend the night there,
and not expect to return until dinner the next day?.This was felt
be a significant change; and though they all met in the Great
House at breakfast rather early, and on the way very punctually,
it was so long after noon for the two carriages, Mr. Musgrove's carriage
containing the four ladies, and the curricle of Charles in which he rode
Captain Wentworth went down the long hill to Lyme, and
entering the even steeper street of the town itself, that it...
very clear that they would have no more than time to look around,
before the light and heat of the day were gone.After securing accommodations and ordering dinner from one of the
inns, the next thing to be done was undoubtedly to walk immediately
to the sea.They came too late in the year for any entertainment
or variety that Lyme, as a public space, could offer.The rooms were
shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, almost no family except the...
residents left; and since there is nothing to admire in the buildings
itself, the remarkable location of the city, the main street
almost rushing into the water, the walk to the Cobb, walking around
the pleasant little bay, enlivened in season with baths
machinery and business; the Cobb itself, are old wonders and new
improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs extending to
the east of the city is what the eye of the stranger will seek; and a whole
it must be a strange stranger who sees no immediate charms
environment of Lyme, so that he would like to get to know it better.The scenes in
its neighborhood, Charmouth, with its high ground and expansive
vast lands, and even more so, the lovely, reclusive bay, backed by
dark cliffs, where fragments of low rock between the sand, make it
happiest place to watch the tide, to sit in
tireless contemplation; the woody varieties of the cheerful village
Up Lyme; and especially Pinny, with its green gaps between romantic
rocks, where the scattered forest trees and orchards of lush
growth, declare that many generations must have died since the
first partial fall of the cliff prepared the ground for such a
stands, where a scene so beautiful and so lovely is exhibited, like may
more than equal to all similar scenes from the famous Isle of
Wight: these places must be visited and revisited every
value of Lyme understood.The company from Uppercross comes along the now deserted and
melancholic looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves
at the coast; and linger alone because everyone has to linger and stare at one
first return to the sea, which ever deserved to look at it,
went to the Cobb, their object in themselves and beyond
Captain Wentworth's bill: for a small house, at the foot of a
old pier of unknown date, where the Harvilles settled?.Captain
Wentworth turned to visit his friend; the others walked on, and he
was to accompany them on the Cobb.They certainly were not tired of wonder and admiration; and not even
Louisa seemed to sense that they had long said goodbye to Captain Wentworth,
when they saw him coming after them, with three companions, all well
by description already known as Captain and Mrs. Harville, and a ...
Captain Benwick, who stayed with them hen.Captain Benwick had been a first lieutenant of the Laconia some time ago;
and the report Captain Wentworth had given of him on his return...
van Lyme, his warm praise for him as an excellent young man and
an officer he had always held in high esteem must have been stamped
him well in the esteem of each listener, was followed by a little
history of his private life, which made him extremely interesting
in the eyes of all the ladies.He was engaged to Captain
Harville's sister, now mourning her loss.They were a year ago
or two waiting for fortune and promotion.Fortune came to be
prize money as a lieutenant who is big; also the promotion finally came;
but Fanny Harville has not seen it for long.She had died the foregoing
summer while he was at sea.Captain Wentworth believed it was impossible
that the man was more attached to the woman than poor Benwick had been
Fanny Harville, or to be more tormented by the terrible
change.He considered his disposition to be of the kind that suffered
heavy, uniting very strong feelings with calm, serious and withdrawn
manners, and a distinct taste for reading and sedentary activities.To
make the interest of the story, the friendship between him and the
Harvilles, if possible, seemed bolstered by the event that closed everything
their vision of alliance, and Captain Benwick now lived with them
whole.Captain Harville had his current home for a half
year; his taste, and his health, and his fortune, everything led him to ...
a cheap house, and by the sea; and the greatness of the
land, and Lyme's retirement in winter, seemed precise
adapted to Captain Benwick's state of mind.The sympathy and good will
excited to Captain Benwick was very great."And yet," Anne said to herself, as they now walked forward to the
party, "he may not have a more sorrowful heart than I have".I
can't believe his prospects are forever so ruined.He is younger than
I am; younger in feeling, if not in fact; younger as a man.He will
rally again, and be happy with another."

They all met and were introduced.Captain Harville was tall, dark
man, with a sensible, benevolent face; a little weak; and from
strong traits and lack of health, much older than the master
Wentworth.Captain Benwick looked, and was, the youngest of the three,
and, compared to one of them, a short man.He was having a good time
face and a melancholy look, as he should have, and withdrew from...
conversation.Captain Harville, though Captain Wentworth is unmatched in manners,
was a perfect gentleman, unfazed, warm and obliging.Mrs. Harville,
a degree less polished than her husband, however, the...
the same good feelings; and nothing is more pleasant than them
desire to see the whole party as friends of their own, because
Captain Wentworth's friends, or more hospitable than them
supplications for all of them who promise to dine with them.Dinner,
already ordered at the inn, was finally accepted, although reluctantly
as an excuse; but they almost seemed hurt that Captain Wentworth would ...
have brought such a party to Lyme, without seeing it as anything
of course they have to dine with them.In all this and so there was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth
an enchanting charm in a degree of hospitality so unusual, so different
the usual style of give-and-take invitations and dinners of formality
and show that Anne felt that her mind was unlikely to benefit
an increasing fame among his brother officers."These would
have all been my friends, ”was her thought; and she had to struggle ...
against a great tendency to humility.Leaving the Cobb, they all went in with their newfound friends,
and found rooms as small as none but those who invite from the heart
would be able to accommodate so many.Anne had a moment
amazement at the subject itself; but it was soon lost in the
more pleasant feelings that sprang from the sight of all the ingenuity
thoughts and nice arrangements from Captain Harville, to the
actual space to the best account, to the shortcomings of
guest house furniture, and defend the windows and doors from the
winter storms to be expected.The varieties in the decor of the
rooms, where the common necessities of the owner, in the
common indifferent plight, were contrasted with some articles of a
rare woods, excellently processed and with something remarkable
and valuable from all the distant lands Captain Harville had
visited were more than amusing for Anne; connected as it all was with
his profession, the fruit of his efforts, the effect of his influence
on his habits, the image of tranquility and domestic happiness it
presented, it made for her something more or less than satisfaction.Captain Harville was not a reader; but he had a great idea
accommodations, and old-fashioned very nice planks, for a bearable
collection of well bound books owned by Captain Benwick.To be
lameness prevented him from moving much; but a spirit of it
practicality and ingenuity seemed to provide him with constant work
within.He drew, he painted, he hammered, he glued; he made toys
for the children; he made new net needles and pins with
improvements; and when everything else was done, he sat down on his big side
fishing net in a corner of the room.Anne thought she had left a lot of happiness behind when they stopped using the
House; and Louisa, through whom she found herself walking, burst out
delight of admiration and delight at the character of the navy; their
kindness, their fraternity, their openness, their uprightness;
protesting that she was convinced that sailors were worth more and ...
warmth than any other bunch of men in England; that they only knew how
life, and they only deserved to be respected and loved.They went back to dress and have dinner; and so well had the schedule answered
even though there was nothing wrong; although it is "so complete"
out of season ", and the" no arterial road of Lyme ", and the" no "
expectation of company, 'had brought many excuses from the minds of
the cafe.Anne found herself becoming so much more hardened to be by then
in the company of Captain Wentworth than she had initially imagined
ever, that it is now sitting at the same table with him, and the
exchange of the common pleasantries that were present (they never have
further), had become nothing more.The nights were too dark for the ladies to see each other again until tomorrow,
but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening; and he
came and brought his friend too, which was more than expected,
it was agreed that Captain Benwick all looked
being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers.He dared
among them again, although his mind certainly did not appear
suitable for the gaiety of the party in general.While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the conversation on one side of the ...
room, and by going back to the old days, it provided anecdotes in abundance
to keep the others busy and entertained, it fell on Anne's lot to be placed
rather unusual with Captain Benwick; and a really good boost from her
nature obliges her to meet him.He was shy, and
prone to abstraction; but the endearing gentleness of her countenance,
and the gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect; and Anne was doing well
paid back the first effort of effort.He was apparently a young man of
considerable taste in reading, although mainly in poetry; and
except for the belief that he had given him at least one evening
indulge in the discussion of subjects, which are usual companions
probably didn't care, she had hopes of being really useful to
him in some suggestions regarding the duty and benefit of wrestling
against oppression that grew naturally from them
conversation.Because although he seemed shy, he didn't seem reserved; it would have preferred
the appearance of feelings that are happy to break their usual limitations; and
have talked about poetry, the richness of the present time, and are gone?
by a brief comparison of opinions about the first-class poets,
trying to determine if Marmion or The Lady of the Lake would be
preference, and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos; and
moreover, how the Giaour should be pronounced, he showed himself that way
familiar with all the tenderest songs of that one poet, and
all passionate descriptions of the other's hopeless pain; he
repeated, with such a trembling feeling, the different lines that a
broken heart, or a mind destroyed by misery, and looked like this
quite as if he wanted to be understood, that she dared to hope that he
didn't always just read poetry, and to say she thought it was
the misfortune of poetry that can rarely be safely enjoyed by those who
fully enjoyed it; and that the strong feelings that alone could
guess it was really the feelings it should taste but
sparingly.His appearance shows that he is not hurt, but is content with this allusion to his
situation, she was encouraged to continue; and feel within themselves
right to seniority, she ventured to recommend a larger one
allowance of prose in his daily study; and on request for
Specificize, named such works by our best moralists, such as
collections of the most beautiful letters, such as memoirs of characters of value
and suffering, as occurred to her at that moment as calculated to wake up
and strengthen the mind with the highest precepts, and the strongest
examples of moral and religious persistence.Captain Benwick listened intently and seemed grateful for the ...
implied interest; and though with a shaking of the head, and it sighs
explained his lack of faith in the effectiveness of books on grief such as
of him, wrote down the names of those she recommended and promised
buy and read them.When the evening was over, Anne couldn't help but be amused by the idea of ​​...
her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man
which she had never seen before; nor could she help fear it, any more
serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists and
preachers, she had been eloquent at a point where her own conduct
would not bear the examination.Chapter 12


Anne and Henrietta, who considered themselves the earliest of the party, the
next morning agreed to walk to the sea before breakfast.They
went to the sand to watch the tide flow, what a fine one
a southeast breeze came in with all the grandeur that it was
a flat coast allowed.They praised the morning; glorified in the sea;
sympathized with the delight of the fresh-to-the-touch breeze - and were
quiet; until Henrietta suddenly started again with…

"Oh! Yes - I'm pretty sure, with a few exceptions, the ...
sea ​​air is always good.There can be no doubt that it has been from
the greatest service to Dr. Shirley, after his illness, last spring
year.He himself declares that he is coming to Lyme for a month,
did him more good than all the drugs he took; and, that's because of the
sea, makes him always feel young again.Now I can't help thinking about it
too bad he doesn't live by the sea.I think he had
Better leave Uppercross altogether and fixate on Lyme.Not you, Anne?
Don't you agree that it's the best he can do, both of you?
for herself and Mrs. Shirley? She's got cousins ​​here, you know, and a lot
knowledge, which would make her happy, and I'm sure she will
would like to go to a place where she could get medical help
on hand, in case he gets another seizure.I think so
rather melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr. and Mrs. Shirley,
who have done good all their lives and worn out their last days
in a place like Uppercross, where they seem closed except for our family
from all over the world.I wish his friends would suggest it to him.I
really think they should.And as for obtaining a dispensation, there
couldn't be a problem in his time of life, and with his character.My
some doubt is whether anything could convince him to leave his parish.He is so very strict and rigorous in his views; too meticulous I
must say.Don't you think, Anne, it's overly scrupulous? Do not
you think it's quite a fault of conscience when a preacher...
sacrifices his health for duties, which might as well be
performed by another person? And also at Lyme, only seventeen miles
out, he'd be close enough to hear it, if people thought he was
something to complain about."

Anne smiled to herself more than once during this speech and went inside
in the subject, as willing to do good by addressing the feelings of
a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good from a lower one
standard, because what could be offered other than general consent? She said
anything reasonable and appropriate for the business; felt the claims of
dr. Shirley to rest as she should; saw how very desirable that was
he should have an active, respectable young man as a resident
chaplain, and was even courteous enough to point out the benefit of such
resident chaplain is getting married.'I wish,' said Henrietta, very pleased with her companion, 'I wish
Lady Russell lived in Uppercross and was intimate with Dr Shirley.I
always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence
with everyone! I always see her as someone who can convince someone
something! I'm scared of her like I told you before, pretty scared
hers, because she's so very smart; but I respect her amazingly, and
wish we had a neighbor like that at Uppercross."

Anne was amused by Henrietta's way of being grateful, and amused
also that the state of affairs and Henrietta's new interests
her friend's views were completely in favor of one of the
Musgrove family; she only had time for a general answer, and
a wish that such another woman was in Uppercross, before all subjects
stopped suddenly when they saw Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming
them.They also came for a walk until breakfast probably would be
ready; but Louisa immediately remembered that she...
something to buy in a shop invited them all to go back with her
Downtown.They were all at her disposal.When they got to the stairs that led up from the beach, a
sir, as he was getting ready to come down, he pulled politely
back, and stopped to give them the right of way.They mounted and passed him; and
as they passed, Anne's face caught his eye and he looked at her with a…
degree of genuine admiration, to which she could not be insensitive.She looked remarkably good; hair very regular, very beautiful
characteristics, with the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine
wind that had blown upon her skin, and by the spirit of
eye that also produced it.It was clear that Mr.
(quite a gentleman to get along with) admired her extremely.Captain
Wentworth immediately looked at her in a way that showed him ...
notice it.He shot her a fleeting glance, a look of
clarity, which seemed to say, "That man was hit with you, and even
I'm seeing something like Anne Elliot again right now."

After she attended Louisa through her company, and hang out about one
a little longer they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing
then quickly from her own room to their dining room, had
almost bumped into the same gentleman as he from one
adjoining apartment.She had previously suspected he was a stranger
like herself, and determined that a good-looking groom, who was
strolling around near the two inns when they got back should be his?
servant.Both the master and the man in mourning helped the idea.It
was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as herself; and this
second meeting, however short it was, again proved by Mr
looks, that he thought her very beautiful, and by the willingness and ...
appropriateness of his apologies that he was an extraordinarily good man
manners.He looked about thirty years old, and though he wasn't pretty, he had a ...
pleasant person.Anne felt she wanted to know who he was.They had almost had breakfast when the sound of a carriage (almost
the first they'd heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party to
the window.It was a gentlemen's carriage, a curriculum, but coming alone
around from the stable to the front door; someone has to go
away.It was operated by a mourning servant.The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump to compare
it with its own; the grieving servant aroused Anne's curiosity, and
the whole six were gathered to watch, by the time the owner of the
curricle could be seen coming out of the door amid the arches and
pleasantries of the household, and sit down, to drive away."Ah!" exclaimed Captain Wentworth, instantly and with half a glance at . . .
Anne, 'it's the man we passed."

Miss Musgroves agreed; and after I watched him as kindly as...
as far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.The waiter entered the room shortly afterwards?.'Pray,' said Captain Wentworth immediately, 'could you tell us the name?
of the gentleman who just left? "

"Yes sir, a Mr. Elliot, a gentleman of great fortune, came in last ...
night from Sidmouth.Dare to say you heard the carriage, sir, while you
were eating; and now for Crewkherne, on the way to Bath and
London."

"Elliot!" Many had looked at each other, and many had
name, before all this had come through, even by the smart speed
from a waiter."Bless me!" cried Mary; "it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr. Mr
Elliot, you have to! Charles, Anne, isn't it? In mourning, you
look, just like our Mr. Elliot must be.How special! In the
same inn with us! Anne, shouldn't it be our Mr. Elliot? my
father's next heir? Pray sir, "turn to the waiter", not you
his servant did not say whether he belonged to the Kellynch
family?"

"No, ma'am, he didn't mention any particular family, but he said his ...
master was a very wealthy gentleman, and would one day become baron night."

"There! See!" cried Mary in ecstasy, "as I said! Heir of...
Sir Walter Elliot! I was sure it would come out, if it did.Trust it, that's a circumstance his servants take care of
publish wherever he goes.But Anne, just imagine how extraordinary!
I wish I had looked at him more.I wish we knew in time who
it was that he would have been introduced to us.What a pity that we
shouldn't have been introduced to each other! Do you think he's the?
Elliot face? I barely looked at him, I looked at the
horses; but I think he had something of the Elliot face, I
wonder the poor didn't hit me! Oh! the overcoat hung over
the panel, and hid the arms, so did it; otherwise I'm sure I should
observed them, and the livery too; if the servant had not been there
mourning, one should have known him by the livery."

"All these extraordinary circumstances add up," he said
Captain Wentworth, "we should take it as the appointment of
Providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin."

When she could get Mary's attention, Anne quietly tried to convince
her that their father and Mr. Elliot had not been for years
such terms that make the power of an attempt at introduction at all
desirable.At the same time, however, it was a secret satisfaction to himself
saw her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch was
no doubt a gentleman, and had an air of common sense.she wouldn't,
at least mention that she has met him for the second time;
luckily Mary didn't pay much attention to the fact that they had passed him nearby
their earlier walk, but she would have felt pretty badly used by Anne's
who actually ran against him in the corridor, and received him greatly
polite apologies, when she had never been near him; no that
The little interview with a niece must remain a complete secret.'Of course,' said Mary, 'will you say that we have Mr. Elliot, the
next time you write to bath write.I think my dad should definitely hear it
of it; tell everything about him."

Anne avoided a direct answer, but it was just the circumstance that she
considered not only unnecessary to be communicated, but what?
should be suppressed.The offense committed to her father,
many years ago she knew; Elizabeth's special part in it
presumptive; and that Mr. Elliot's idea always irritated both of them
was beyond question.Mary herself never wrote to Bath; all the toil of
maintaining a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth fell
on Anne.Breakfast was not long over when they were joined by Captain and...
Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they agreed to take
their last walk across Lyme.They should leave
Uppercross with one, and by now they would all be together, and
out the door as long as they could.Anne noticed that Captain Benwick was approaching her as soon as they were all there
reasonable on the street.Their conversation the night before didn't work
keep him from looking for her again; and they walked together for a while
talking as before about Mr Scott and Lord Byron, and still as inept as...
before, and as powerless as the other two readers, to think exactly the same
of the merits of either, until something an almost universal
change in their company, and instead of Captain Benwick she had ...
Captain Harville by her side."Miss Elliot," he said, speaking rather softly, "you have done a good deed...
to make that poor guy talk so much.I wish he could have something like that
more company.I know, it's bad for him to be locked up the way he is;
but what can we do? We cannot divorce."

“No,” said Anne, “I can easily believe it's impossible, but inside
time, perhaps - we know what time does in any case of tribulation, and
Don't forget, Captain Harville, that your friend may still be called
a young grieving - only last summer, I understand?."

"Yes, true enough," (with a deep sigh) "only June."

'And maybe not so soon known to him."

"Not until the first week of August, when he got home from the Cape,
just made in the Grappler.I was afraid to hear about it in Plymouth
him; he sent letters, but the Grappler had orders for ...
Portsmouth.There the news should follow him, but who would tell?
not me.I would have run to the wharf just as quickly.no one could
do it, but that good guy "(pointing to Captain Wentworth).) "De
Laconia had arrived in Plymouth the week before; no danger to her being
sent back to sea.He took his chance for the rest; wrote for
leave, but without waiting for the return, traveled overnight and
day till he got to Portsmouth, at which point rowed to the Grappler,
and never left the poor guy for a week.That's what he did, and
no one else could have saved poor James.You may think, Miss Elliot,
whether he is dear to us! "

Anne thought perfectly about the question and said so
in response as her own feeling could achieve, or as his own seemed to be able ...
bear, because he was too touched to renew the subject, and when he...
spoke again, it was of something completely different.Mrs. Harville gives it as her opinion that her husband would have...
walking enough by the time he got home, the
direction of the whole party in what would be their last walk; they
would accompany them to their door, then return and depart
herself.By all their calculations, there was just time for it;
but as they approached the Cobb, there was such a general desire to walk
again they were all so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so
determined, that the difference of fifteen minutes, turned out,
would be no difference at all; so with all the friendly goodbyes, and
all the friendly exchange of invitations and promises that can be
imagined they parted from Captain and Mrs. Harville at their own doors,
and still accompanied by Captain Benwick, who seemed to cling to them
until the last, went on to make the correct adieu to the Cobb.Anne found Captain Benwick getting close again.Lord Byron's "dark"
blue seas 'could not but be brought forward by their present
view, and she gladly gave him all her attention for so long
was possible.It was quickly drawn, in a different way.There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant
for the ladies, and they agreed to go down the stairs, and
all were content to descend the steep flight calmly and carefully,
with the exception of Louisa; she needs to be jumped down by Captain Wentworth.He had had to jump her off the gates on all their walks; the
sensation was wonderful for her.The hardness of the pavement for her
feet, made him less willing on this occasion; he did it
however.She was safe below, and instantaneously, to show her pleasure,
ran up the stairs to be jumped down again.He advised her against it,
thought the pot was too big; but no, he reasoned and spoke in vain, she
smiled and said: "I am determined that I will:" he held out his hands; they
was half a second too fast, she fell to the sidewalk on the
Lower Cobb, and was taken lifeless! There was no wound, no blood,
no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed, she was not breathing, her face
was like death.The horror of the moment for everyone who was there!

Captain Wentworth, who had caught up with her, knelt with her in his arms,
looking at her with a face as pale as hers, in agony of ...
Silence."She's dead! She's dead!" Mary shouted, grabbing it
her husband, and with his own disgust contributed to make him
immovable; and at another time, Henrietta, sink under the
conviction, also lost her mind and would have fallen on the stairs,
but for Captain Benwick and Anne, who caught and supported her in between
them."Is there no one to help me?" were the first words that came true
Captain Wentworth, in a tone of despair and as if he had all his own strength kracht
were gone."Go to him, go to him," Anne cried, "for God's sake go to him ....I
can support her herself.leave me and go to him.Rub her hands, rub
its temples; here are salts; take them, take them."

Captain Benwick obeyed, and at the same time Charles broke away
himself from his wife, they were both with him; and Louisa was brought up
supported and firmer between them, and all was done that
Anne had urged, but in vain; while Captain Wentworth, staggeringly ...
against the wall for his support, cried in the bitterest pain:

"Oh God! Her mom and dad!"

"A surgeon!" said Anne.He caught the word; it seemed to wake him up right away and just say ...
"That's true, a surgeon right now," Anne shot away
eagerly suggested--

Captain Benwick, wouldn't it be better for Captain Benwick? He knows ...
where to find a surgeon."

Everyone who was able to think felt the benefit of the idea, and in a
moment (it all happened in quick moments) Captain Benwick had resigned
the poor corpse-like figure fully in the care of the brother, and was
at the fastest speed to the city.As for the miserable party left behind, it could hardly be said which one
of the three, who were completely rational, suffered the most: Captain
Wentworth, Anne or Charles, who, a really affectionate brother,
hung over Louisa with grief, and could only avert his eyes
a sister, to see the other in a state as insensitive, or to testify
the hysterical excitement of his wife, calling him for help, that he
could not give.Anne, present with all strength and zeal, and thought, what,
instinct delivered, to Henrietta, still tried, intermittently, to suggest
comfort to the others, tried to calm Mary, to animate Charles, to
to soften Captain Wentworth's feelings.Both seemed to be looking at her
for directions."Anne, Anne," cried Charles, "what is to be done now? What, in
the name of heaven, is the following to be done? "

Captain Wentworth's eyes were on her too."Isn't she better carried to the inn? Yes, I'm sure: carry her draag
carefully to the inn."

'Yes, yes, to the inn,' repeated Captain Wentworth comparatively
collected, and eager to do something.'I will carry her myself zelf.Musgrove, take care of the others."

By then, the report of the accident had been circulated among the workers
and boatmen about the Cobb, and many were gathered to them to be
useful if you want to at least enjoy the sight of a dead young lady,
no, two dead young ladies, because it turned out to be twice as beautiful as the first
report.To some of the prettiest of these good people, Henrietta was
sent, for although she came back to life in part, she was quite helpless; and
this way Anne walked by her side and Charles took care of his
woman, they went forward, retreating with unspeakable feelings, the
ground, so recent, so recent, and so light-hearted, they ...
had passed.They weren't off the Cobb until the Harvilles met them hen.Captain
Benwick had been seen flying past their house, with a face that ...
showed that something was wrong; and they immediately left
informed and guided as they pass, to the spot the.Shocked like
Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves
immediately usable; and a look between him and his wife decided what it was
to do.She must be taken to their house; all have to go to their
House; and wait there for the surgeon's arrival.They wouldn't listen
scruples: he was obeyed; they were all under his roof; and while
Louisa was led up the stairs under the direction of Mrs. Harville, and
owning her own bed, assistance, heartfelt thanks, restoratives
were delivered by her husband to everyone who needed her.Louisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed again, without them
apparent consciousness.However, this had been proof of life
service to her sister; and Henrietta, though utterly incapable of...
being in the same room with Louisa was kept by the excitement of hope
and fear, of a return of her own insensitivity.Mary was too
become calmer.The surgeon was with them almost before it seemed possible.They
were sick with disgust while he investigated; but he was not hopeless.The
head had suffered a serious contusion, but he had seen more serious injuries
recovered from: he was by no means hopeless; he said cheerfully.That he didn't consider it a desperate case, that he didn't say:
a few hours had to end, it was felt at first, unimaginably; and
the ecstasy of such a delay, the joy, deep and silent, after a
few fiery ejaculations of gratitude were offered to heaven, May
to be conceived.The tone, the look with which "Thank God!" was voiced by captain
Wentworth, Anne was sure she would never be forgotten by her; nor the sight
from him afterwards, as he sat at a table, leaning over it with folded
arms and face hidden, as if overwhelmed by the different feelings of
his soul, and by trying to calm them through prayer and reflection.Louisa's limbs had escaped.There was no injury other than the head.It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be
done, as for their general situation.They could talk now
each other and consultation.However, Louisa must stay where she was
disturbing for her friends to involve the Harvilles in this...
effort, admitted no doubt.Her removal was impossible.The
Harvilles silenced all scruples; and, as far as they could, all of them
gratitude.They had looked ahead and arranged everything before the
others began to think.Captain Benwick has to give up his room
them, and take another bed elsewhere; and everything was arranged.They
were only concerned that the house could no longer accommodate; and yet
maybe by "putting the kids away in the maid's room, or rocking"
a cot somewhere, ' they could hardly think they wouldn't find a place
for two or three moreover, if they wanted to stay; although,
with regard to any presence on Miss Musgrove, there need not be:
the slightest inconvenience to leave her completely to Mrs. Harville.Mrs
Harville was a very accomplished nurse, and her nanny, who ...
lived with her for a long time, and went around with her all over, was just such a ...
another.Between these two she might not want to have a presence aanwezigheid
day or night.And all of this was said with a truth and sincerity of it
feel irresistible.Charles, Henrietta and Captain Wentworth were the three in
consultation, and for a short time it was only an exchange of
confusion and terror."Uppercross, the need for someone to go"
to Uppercross; the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to mr
and Mrs. Musgrove; late morning; an hour has already passed
because they should have been out; the impossibility of being inside
acceptable time."In the beginning they were unable to do anything
purpose than such exclamations; but after a while, Captain Wentworth,
make an effort, said:

"We have to be decided, and without losing another minute.Each
minute is valuable.Someone has to decide to go to Uppercross
immediately.Musgrove, you or I should go."

Charles agreed, but declared his decision not to leave.He
would be as little trouble as possible for Captain and Mrs. Harville;
but as for leaving his sister in such a condition, he shouldn't, nor
would.Up to now it had been decided; and Henrietta first declared the
the same.However, she was soon persuaded to think differently.The
use of her stay! Those who couldn't stay in it
Louisa's room, or to look at her without the suffering that made her
worse than helpless! She was forced to admit she could
not good, but still was not ready to be gone, until, touched by the ...
thought of her father and mother, she gave up; she agreed, she
was afraid to be home.The plan had reached this point when Anne quietly came down from…
Louisa's room could only hear what followed, in front of the parlor door
was open."Then it is certain, Musgrove," cried Captain Wentworth, "that you ...
stay and take care of your sister's house.But as for the rest, if
to the others, if anyone stays to assist Mrs. Harville, I think it must be
but one.Mrs. Charles Musgrove would of course like to come back to that
her children; but if Anne stays, no one so neat, as skilled as
Anne."

She paused to recover from the emotion of hearing herself that way
talked about.The other two agreed wholeheartedly with what he said, and so did she
popped up."You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and take care of her;" he cried,
turning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a softness, that
almost seemed to restore the past.She colored deep, and he
remembered himself and walked away.She expressed herself the most
ready, ready, happy to stay.“It was what she imagined
of, and wanting to do.A bed on the floor at Louisa
space would suffice for her, if only Mrs. Harville would think so."

One more thing, and everything seemed settled.Although it was before
desirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove be alarmed earlier by some
part of the delay; but still the time the Uppercross horses need to take
them back, would be a terrible extension of the tension; and captain
Wentworth suggested, and Charles Musgrove agreed, that it would be a lot
better for him to take a lounger from the inn and leave Mr. Musgrove's?
carriage and horses to be sent home early the next morning, when there
would be the further benefit of sending a report of Louisa's night.Captain Wentworth was now in a hurry to get everything done on his side,
and soon followed by the two ladies.When the plan was made
Known to Mary, however, all peace came to an end.She was
so miserable and so vehement, complained so much about injustice in existence?
expected to leave instead of Anne; Anne, who was nothing to Louisa,
while she was her sister, and had the best right to stay at Henrietta's
place! Why wouldn't she be as helpful as Anne? And to go home
even without Charles, without her husband! No, it was too unkind.And
in short, she said more than her husband could resist for long, and so
none of the others could resist when he gave in, there was no help for that
it; Mary's change for Anne was inevitable.Anne had never grudgingly submitted to the jealous and...
ill-judgmental claims from Mary; but so it must be, and they left for the
town, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick attending ...
to her.As they hurried, she remembered for a moment...
the small circumstances that the same spots earlier in
the morning.There she had listened to Henrietta's plans for Dr.
Shirley leaves Uppercross; further on, she had first seen Mr. Elliot;
For a moment it seemed all that could now be given to anyone but Louisa, or
those involved in her well-being.Captain Benwick was very considerate of her; and united as
they all seemed through the distress of the day, she felt an increasing
degree of benevolence towards him, and even a pleasure to think so
it might be the opportunity to continue their acquaintance.Captain Wentworth watched for them, and a chaise lounge and four in
waiting, stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the
street; but his obvious surprise and annoyance at the replacement of
one sister to another, the change in his countenance, the
amazement, the expressions started and suppressed, with which Charles
listened, but a humiliating reception from Anne; or must be added
At the very least, convince her that she was only appreciated if she could be useful for it
Louisa.She tried to be calm and fair.Without mimicking the
feelings of an Emma towards her Henry, which she would have paid attention to
Louisa with a zeal beyond the usual claims of esteem, for his sake; and
she hoped he wouldn't be so unjust for long as to assume she'd shrink
unnecessarily from a friend's office.Meanwhile she was sitting in the carriage.He had handed them both in,
and placed himself between them; and in this way among these
circumstances, full of surprise and emotion for Anne, she stopped
Lyme.How the long stage would go; what it was like to influence them
manners; what their kind of community would be, she couldn't
to provide.However, it was all very natural.He was devoted to
Henrietta; always turning to her; and if he spoke at all, always
with the intention of sustaining her hope and brightening her up.In
overall, his voice and manner were jealously calm.To save Henrietta
of agitation seemed to be the guiding principle.Once, when she did
mourned the last ill-judged, ill-fated walk to the Cobb,
bitterly complaining that it had ever been thought of, he burst forth, as…
as completely conquered--

"Don't talk about it, don't talk about it," he shouted."Oh God! I did
not yielded to her at the fatal moment! Had I done what I had to do! But
so eager and so determined! Dear, dear Louisa! "

Anne wondered if it ever occurred to him to
justice of his own previous opinion of the universal bliss and
advantage of solidity of character; and whether it might not hit him
that, like all other qualities of the mind, they are
proportions and limits.She thought it could barely escape him
feeling that a persuasive temper can sometimes be just as supportive
happiness as a very determined character.They got along quickly.Anne was amazed to recognize the same hills and
same objects so fast.Their actual speed, increased by some fear
of the conclusion, made the road seem half as long as it was in the day
before.However, it was getting dark before they got into the
near Uppercross, and there was total silence beneath
she for a while, Henrietta leaning back in the corner, wearing a scarf
all over her face, hoping she has cried herself to sleep;
then, as they went up their last hill, Anne noticed she was all right
addressed once by Captain Wentworth.He said in a low, cautious voice
said:--

'I thought about what we could do best.She shouldn't appear on
first.She couldn't stand it.I've been thinking if you had
no better stay with her in the carriage while I go in and it breaks
to Mr and Mrs Musgrove.Do you think this is a good plan? '

She did: he was satisfied and said nothing more.But the memory of
the appeal remained her pleasure, as a proof of friendship, and of
respect for her judgment, a great pleasure; and then the one
a kind of farewell certificate, its value did not decrease.When the disturbing communication at Uppercross was over, and he had hij
saw the father and mother as calm as one could hope for, and the ...
daughter all the better because she was with them, he announced his intention
to return to Lyme in the same carriage; and when the horses were?
ace, he was gone.(End of part one).)



Chapter 13


The rest of Anne's time in Uppercross, of which I only understood two ...
days, was spent entirely in the Mansion House; and she had the
satisfaction to know oneself extraordinarily useful there, as well as
direct companion, and as an assistant in all those arrangements for the
future, which in the sad mood of Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove,
would have been difficulties.They had an early bill from Lyme the next morning.Louisa was a lot
the same.There were no symptoms worse than before.Charles came
a few hours later, to submit a later and more specific report.He
was fairly cheerful.A quick cure is not to be hoped for, however
everything was up and the nature of the matter was admitted.In
speaking of the Harvilles, he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of gevoel
their kindness, especially from Mrs. Harville's efforts as a nurse."She really left nothing for Mary to do".He and Mary had been
persuaded to go to their inn early last night.Maria had been
hysterical again this morning.When he left, she would...
walking with Captain Benwick, which he hoped would do her good.He
almost wished she'd persuaded her to come home the day before;
but the truth was, Mrs. Harville had nothing to do for anyone."

Charles would return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father had
half a ghost at first to go with him, but the ladies could not agree.It
would only multiply the problems for the others and increase his
own need; and a much better plan followed and was followed.A
a lounger came from Crewkherne, and Charles brought it back
more useful person in the old nanny of the family, someone who
after raising all the kids and seeing the very last one,
dragging and long-stroked master Harry, sent to school after his time
brothers, now lived in her abandoned nursery to mend stockings and
all the blisters and bruises she could get close to her, and who,
was therefore only too happy that he could help the nurse
Dear Miss Louisa.There had been vague wishes to get Sarah there
previously to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta; but it almost wouldn't work without Anne
have been resolved on, and found to be executable so quickly.The next day they owed Charles Hayter an entire minute of gratitude
knowledge of Louisa, which was so essential to each
twenty four hours.He made it his business to go to Lyme, and his...
account was still encouraging.The intervals of sense and
consciousness was supposed to be stronger.Every report agreed
Captain Wentworth must show up in Lyme.Anne would leave them tomorrow, an event they all feared."What do they do without her? They were miserable comforters to ...
each other.And so much was said in this way that Anne thought of her
could do no better than to give among them the general tendency to
she initiated, and she persuaded them all to go straight to Lymeme.They
had little trouble; it was soon decided that they would go; To go
tomorrow they settle in the inn or go home as it is
suitable, and stays there until dear Louisa can be moved.They must be
take some trouble away from the good people she was with; they could
in any case relieve Mrs. Harville from caring for her own children; and in
in short, they were so happy with the decision, which Anne was very happy with
what she had done, and felt she couldn't spend her last morning
at Uppercross better than helping their preparations and shipping
she leaves at an early hour, although she is left to the lonely area
of the house was the result.She was the last, except for the little boys in the house, she was washing
very last, the only one left of all that was filled and animated
both houses, of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character.A few days had indeed changed!

If Louisa recovered, it would all be fine.More than before
happiness would be restored.According to her, there could be no doubt
there was none of what would follow her recovery.Over a few months,
and the room now so deserted, occupied but by her silent, pensive self,
maybe be filled again with all that was happy and cheerful, all that was
glowing and radiant in prosperous love, that was all very different from Anne
Elliot!

One hour of free time for such reflections, on a dark one
November day, a little heavy rain that almost erases the few
objects once seen through the windows was enough to show the
sound of Lady Russell's carriage exceedingly welcome; and yet
longing to be gone, she couldn't leave the Mansion House, or any
adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and comfortable porch,
or even through the foggy glasses of the last humble tenements
the village, without a sad heart.Scenes were over in Uppercross
what made it precious.It stood the record of many sensations of
pain, once severe, but now eased; and of some cases of giving in
feeling, few breaths of friendship and reconciliation, what could...
never to be sought again, and could never cease to be dear.They
left it all behind, except the memory that such things had
been.Anne had never entered Kellynch since she left Lady Russell's house
in September.It hadn't been necessary, and the few times it had
the ability for her to go to the room she designed to dodge and
escape from.Her first return was to resume her place in the modern
and elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to delight her eyes
mistress.There was some apprehension mixed with Lady Russell's joy to meet her.She knew who had visited Uppercross.But luckily also Anne
had improved in plumpness and appearance, or Lady Russell thought her so;
and Anne, on receiving her compliments on the occasion, had the
pleasure to connect them with the silent admiration of her cousin,
and hoping that she would be blessed with a second youth
and beauty.When they started talking to each other, she quickly got a sense of mentality
change.The subjects that had filled her heart when she left vertrek
Kellynch, and what she had felt belittled, and was forced to do
suffocation among the Musgroves, had now become of secondary importance.She had even lost sight of her father and sister and Bath lately.Their worries had sunk beneath Uppercross's; and when Lady
Russell fell into their former hopes and fears, and spoke to her
satisfaction in the house in Camden Place that was taken, and
her regret that Mrs. Clay was still with them, Anne would have done...
was ashamed to know how much more she thought about Lyme
and Louisa Musgrove, and all her acquaintances there; how much more
interesting to her was the home and friendship of the Harvilles and
Captain Benwick, then her own father's house in Camden Place, or her...
own sister's intimacy with Mrs. Clay.She was actually forced to make an effort
herself to meet Lady Russell with something like the appearance of equal
concern, on subjects that naturally had the first claim to her.There was a bit of awkwardness at first in their discourse on another
subjects.They need to talk about the Lyme accident.Lady Russell had
the day before five minutes not arrived, then a full bill of
the whole thing had jumped over her; but still it has to be talked about, it has to
makes inquiries, she must regret the carelessness, regret the result, and
Captain Wentworth's name must be mentioned by both.Anne was conscious
for not doing it as well as Lady Russell.She couldn't pronounce the name
and look straight ahead at Lady Russell's eye, until she was adopted
the purpose of briefly telling her what she thought of the attachment
between him and Louisa.When told this, his name alarmed her no
longer.Lady Russell had only to listen calmly and wish them happy, but
inwardly her heart enjoyed evil delight, glad contempt,
that the man who was twenty-three seemed to understand somewhat
the value of an Anne Elliot, eight years later must be charmed
by a Louisa Musgrove.The first three or four days were the most peaceful, with no circumstances
to mark them, except for receiving a few notes from Lyme, which:
found their way to Anne, she didn't know how, and brought one rather
improving Louisa's account.At the end of that period, Lady Russell's
politeness could no longer rest, and the weaker self-threats of
the past was in a decided tone, "I have to appeal to Mrs. Croft; I really ...
must visit her soon.Anne, do you have the courage to come with me and pay
a visit in that house? It will be an ordeal for both of us."

Anne didn't shy away from it; on the contrary, she really felt like she was
said, in observing ...

"I think you will most likely suffer most of the two; your...
feelings are less reconciled with the change than mine.By staying indoors
the neighborhood, I've gotten used to it."

She could have said more about it; because in fact she had such a high an
opinion of the Crofts, and found her father so happy in it
his tenants, so surely thought the parish a good example, and the
poor of the best attention and relief, that however regretful and ashamed
for the necessity of the removal, she could not help but feel in conscience
that they were gone who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall
had passed into better hands than the owners'.These beliefs must
no doubt have their own pain, and serious was his kind; but they
ruled out that pain Lady Russell would suffer entering the
home again, and back through the well-known apartments.At times like that, Anne couldn't say to herself, “These rooms
should only be ours.Oh, how fallen at their destination! How
unworthy occupied! An old family to be so far away!
Strangers fill their place! 'No, unless she thought of her
mother, and remembered where she used to sit and preside, she
had no sigh of that description to lift.Mrs. Croft always met her with a kindness that gave her the pleasure of...
considering itself a favourite, and on the present occasion, receiving
her in that house, there was special attention.The sad accident at Lyme soon became the dominant topic, and so on
comparing their latest accounts of the invalids, it was found that each of them
lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yore; Which
Captain Wentworth had been to Kellynch yesterday (for the first time since ...
the accident), Anne had brought the last note, which she hadn't been
able to trace the exact steps of; stayed for a few hours and then
returned to Lyme, and with no intention of quitting
it no more.He had inquired about her, she discovered in particular; had
expressed his hope that Miss Elliot would not be worse for her haar
efforts, and had spoken of those efforts as great.This was
pretty, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else
have done.As for the sad catastrophe itself, it can only be examined at once
style by a pair of stable, sensible women, whose judgment had to ...
work on established events; and it was perfectly decided that it was so
was the result of much thought and much carelessness; Which
the effects were very disturbing, and it was terrifying to think how
Long may Miss Musgrove's recovery be in doubt, and how liable she is hoe
would still suffer from the concussion after this! The
Admiral closed it succinctly by exclaiming:

'Yes, a very bad thing indeed.This is a new kind of way for young people
man who make love, by breaking the head of his mistress, isn't it,
Miss Elliot? This is a headbreak and a plaster, really! "

Admiral Croft's manners weren't quite the tone that suited Lady
Russell, but they were happy with Anne.His goodness of heart and simplicity
of character were irresistible."Now, this must be very bad for you," he said, suddenly rising from a…
little reverie, "to come and find us here".I did not have
reminded me earlier, I declare, but it must be very bad.But do it now
do not stand on ceremony.Get up and look at all the rooms in the house
if you like it."

"Another time, sir, thank you, not now"."

"Well, when it suits you.You can slip out of the undergrowth in at
every moment; and there you will see that we hang our umbrellas along
that door.A good place isn't it? But "(checks itself)", you
won't find a good spot because yours were always in the
butlerler's room.Yes, it always is, I believe.The manners of a man can be
as good as anyone else's, but we all love our best.And so should you
judge for yourself whether it would be better for you to
home or not."

Anne, discovering she might refuse it, did so, very gratefully."We have also made few changes," the admiral continued
let me think a moment."Very little.We told you about the laundry door, at
Upper cross.That has been a huge improvement.The miracle was,
how a family on earth could bear her discomfort?
open like it did, so long! You will tell Sir Walter what we have
and that Mr. Shepherd thinks it's the greatest home improvement?
ever had.Indeed, I must do ourselves justice to say that the few
changes we've made have all been very much for the better.My
however the wife should have the honor of them.I have done very little
besides sending away some of my big sight glasses
dressing room that belonged to your father.A very good man, and a lot
the gentleman I am sure: but I should think, Miss Elliot," (looking atd
with serious reflection), "I would think he must be quite dressed
man for his time of life.What a number of glasses! o Lord!
there was no escape from itself.So I got Sophy to lend me one
hand, and soon we shifted their quarters; and now I'm very cozy, with
my little shaving glass in a corner, and another great thing that I do
never come near."

Anne, despite herself amused, was rather distressed at an answer,
and the admiral, fearing he might not be polite enough, took
the topic again, to say...

'The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot, give it
My compliments to him and Mrs. Croft's, and say we're settled here
completely to our liking, and have not found a single fault with the place.The chimney in the breakfast room smokes a little, I admit, but it's just...
when the wind is due north and blowing hard, which may not happen three
times a winter.And take it all the way now that we've been in it
most of the houses around here and can review, there is not one we
like better than this.Just say it, with my compliments.He will be
glad to hear it."

Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very pleased with each other: but
the knowledge that started this visit was destined not to go far
Gift; because when it was sent back, the Crofts announced themselves
are leaving for a few weeks to visit their connections in the north
of the county, and probably no longer home for Lady
Russell would move to Bath.So all danger ended for Anne to meet Captain Wentworth in Kellynch
Hall, or to see him in the company of her friend.Everything was safe
enough, and she smiled at the many anxious feelings she'd wasted
the subject.Chapter 14


Although Charles and Mary took much longer after Mr
Mrs. Musgrove then goes on to realize that she could have been Anne at all
wanted, they were the first of the family back home; and
they drove there as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross
the lodge.They had left Louisa on her feet; but her head
though bright, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves prone to the
highest extreme of tenderness; and though she could be pronounced to be
everything went very well, it was still impossible to say when they were when
could carry the move home; and her father and mother, who
must return in time to receive their younger children for Christmas
holiday, hardly had any hope of being able to take her with me.They had all been in lodgings together.Mrs. Musgrove had Mrs.
Harville's children away as much as they could, every possible stock
van Uppercross was decorated to reduce the inconvenience to the
Harvilles, when the Harvilles wanted them to come and eat
every day; and in short, it seemed to have been but a struggle for each elk
which side should be most disinterested and welcoming?.Mary had hurt her; but in general, as was clear by her
She stayed so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.Charles
Hayter had been to Lyme more times than suited her; and when they ate?
at the Harvilles there had been only a maid to wait, and at
first, Mrs. Harville had always given priority to Mrs. Musgrove; but then,
she had received such a clever apology from her when she found out
whose daughter she was, and there was so much going on every day,
there had been so many walks between their home and the Harvilles,
and she had taken books from the library and changed them so many times
the balance would certainly have been in Lyme's favor.She was
brought also to Charmouth, and she had bathed herself, and she had gone to church,
and there were many more people to watch in the church
Lyme then at Uppercross; and all this, connected with the feeling of being that way
very useful, had a really pleasant fortnight.Anne inquired about Captain Benwick Ben.Mary's face was instantly clouded.Charles laughed.'Oh! Captain Benwick is fine, I believe, but he is very strange
young man.I don't know where it would be.We asked him to come
a day or two at our house: Charles promised to give him something
shooting, and he seemed very elated, and as for me, I thought so
was all arranged; when see! on Tuesday night he made a very clumsy
kind of excuse; 'he never fired' and he was 'quite misunderstood',
and he promised this, and he promised that, and the end of it...
I discovered that he had no intention of coming.I suppose he was afraid of
find it boring; but at my word I should have thought we were alive
enough in the Cottage for such a heartbroken man as Captain Benwick."

Charles laughed again and said, "Well Mary, you know very well how...
was real.You did it all,' (turns to Anne.) "He liked it"
that if he went with us, he would find you around: he imagined ...
anyone who lives in Uppercross; and when he discovered that lady
Russell lived three miles away, his heart had failed him, and he hadn't
courage to come.That's the fact, on my honor.Mary knows it is."

But Mary didn't give in very graciously, whether or not
given Captain Benwick has the right to perish by birth and situation
love with an Elliot, or of Anne not wanting to believe a bigger one
attractiveness to Uppercross than themselves, should be left to guess.Anne's benevolence, however, was not to be diminished by what she heard.She boldly admitted that she was flattered and continued her questions."Oh! he talks about you," cried Charles, "in such terms--" Mary
interrupted him."I declare, Charles, I have never heard him call Anne
twice the whole time I was there.I declare, Anne, he never talks about you
not at all."

"No," admitted Charles, "I don't know if he ever will, in general
way; but it is very clear that he admires you je
out of the ordinary.His head is full of books that he reads in reading
your recommendation, and he wants to talk to you about it; he has
discovered something in one of them that he thinks - oh! I
can't pretend I remember but it was a very beautiful thing - I ...
heard him tell Henrietta all about it; and then 'Miss Elliot'
it was talked about in the highest terms! Now Mary, I declare that it was, I
heard it yourself, and you were in the other room.Elegance, sweetness,
beauty.'Oh! there was no end to Miss Elliot's charms."

"And I'm sure," cried Mary warmly, "it was just a little bit for him
credit, if he did.Miss Harville only died last June.Such a heart is
worth very little to have; is it, Lady Russell? I'm sure you will
agree with me."

'I need to see Captain Benwick before making up my mind,' said Lady Russell,
smiling."And you will most likely do that very soon, I can tell you, ma'am,"
said Charles."Although he had no nerves to go with us, and ...
then leave again to make a formal visit here, he will make
his way to Kellynch one day on his own, you can depend on it.I
told him the distance and the way, and I told him about the church ...
so well worth seeing; for as he has a predilection for that kind
of things, I thought that would be a good excuse, and he listened in
all his understanding and soul; and i'm sure in his way that you
let him call here soon calling.So I give you a warning, Lady Russell."

'Any acquaintance of Anne is always welcome with me,' was Lady
Russell's kind answer."Oh! As to being Anne's acquaintance," said Mary, "I think he's kinda ...
my acquaintance because I've seen him every day lately
fourteen days."

"Well, if your joint knowledge, then I'll be very happy to see"
Captain Benwick."

'You won't find anything pleasant in him, I assure you, ma'am.He is one of the dullest young men who ever lived.He walked along
me, sometimes, from one end of the sand to the other, without saying a word
word.He is not a well-bred young man at all.I'm sure you won't
like him."

"We're different, Mary," said Anne.'I think Lady Russell would like it
him.I think she would be so happy with his ghost that she
would see no flaw in his manner very soon."

"Me too, Anne," said Charles.'I'm sure Lady Russell would like him.He's just the kind of Lady Russell.Give him a book and he will read everything
day long."

"Yes, he will!" Mary exclaimed mockingly."He will be pooping
about his book, and know not when anyone speaks to him, or when anyone addresses him hem
drop his scissors, or whatever happens.Do you think Lady
Russell would like that? '

Lady Russell laughed.“On my word,” she said, “me
shouldn't have assumed my opinion could have conceded anyone
of such a difference of suspicion, steadfast and factual as I may
call myself.I am really curious about the person who can give
give rise to such directly opposite concepts not.I wish he could be initiated
to call here.And when he does, Mary, you can rest assured that you'll be my...
opinion; but I'm determined not to judge him beforehand hem."

"You won't like him, I'll answer for it."

Lady Russell started talking about something else.Mary spoke to
animation of their meeting with, or rather, Mr Elliot so
out of the ordinary."He's a man," said Lady Russell, "that I don't want to see ....To be
refused to be cordial with the head of his family, has left
a very strong impression in his disgrace on me."

This decision checked Mary's eagerness and briefly put her in
right in the face of Elliot.As to Captain Wentworth, though Anne made no inquiries,
there was sufficient voluntary communication.His ghost had been
strongly recovering lately as expected.While Louisa improved, he
had improved, and he was now a very different being from him
had been the first week.He had not seen Louisa; and was so extreme
afraid of any adverse effect on her from an interview, he did
not insist on it at all; and, on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of
go away for a week or ten days, until her head was stronger.He had
talked about going to Plymouth for a week and wanted to convince him?
Captain Benwick to go with him; but, as Charles claimed to the last,
Captain Benwick seemed much more inclined to drive to Kellynch.There is no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasional
thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.Lady Russell couldn't
hear the doorbell without feeling that it could be his herald; nor
could Anne return from every walk of lonely indulgence in her
father's property, or any charitable visitation in the village, without
wondering if she would see him or hear from him.Captain Benwick
did not come though.He was either less inclined to it than Charles
imagined, or he was too shy; and after indulging him for a week,
Lady Russell decided he was not worth the interest he was taking
started to get excited.The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from
school, with Mrs. Harville's little children, to improve
the noise of Uppercross, and reduce that of Lyme.Henrietta stayed
with Louisa; but the rest of the family was back in the habit
quarters.Lady Russell and Anne paid them their compliments once, when Anne
could not help but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive.Though neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter, nor Captain
Wentworth was there, the room contrasting as strongly as could be
be wished in the last state she saw it in.Immediately around Mrs. Musgrove were the little Harvilles, those
she watched diligently against the tyranny of the two children of children
the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.On one side was a table
occupied by a few babbling girls, cutting silk and gold paper; and
on the other side were bowls and bowls, arching under the weight of muscle power
and cold pies, where dissolute boys romp; the whole
complemented by a blazing Christmas fire that seemed determined
heard despite all the noise from the others.Charles and Mary too
of course popped in on their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of:
Lady Russell paid his respects and sat close to her for ten years
minutes, talking in a very high voice, but from the screams of the
children on his knees, usually in vain.It was a nice family heirloom.Anne, judging by her own temperament, would have found one
domestic hurricane poor recovery of nerves, which Louisa's
sickness must have been shaken so strongly.But Mrs Musgrove, she has Anne
on purpose near her to thank her very much, time and time again, for
all her attention to them, concluded a brief summary of what
she had suffered herself by observing, with a happy look around her
room, that after all she'd been through, nothing was so likely to do?
its good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home.Louisa recovered quickly now.Her mother could even think about her
be at home with their company, before her siblings
went back to school.The Harvilles had promised to go with her and
stay in Uppercross when she comes back?.Captain Wentworth was gone,
for now to see his brother in Shropshire."I hope I will remember it in the future," said Lady Russell as soon as...
they were put back in the carriage, "not to put Uppercross in the."
Christmas break."

Everyone has their taste in sounds as well as in other things; and
sounds are quite harmless, or most disturbing, rather by their kind
than their quantity.When Lady Russell was not long after
Entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving down the long track
from streets of the Old Bridge to Camden Place, in the middle of the
other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays, the howling of
newspapermen, muffin men and milkmen, and the incessant jingle of
pats, she made no complaint.No, these were sounds that came with it
to the winter delights; her spirit rose under their influence; and
like Mrs. Musgrove, though she didn't say she felt that after she...
Long in the country nothing could be better for her than a little silence
cheerfulness.Anne did not share these feelings.She persisted in a very determined,
though very quiet dislike of Bath; caught the first vague view
of the sprawling buildings, smoking in the rain, without any desire to see
them better; felt their progress through the streets to be real
unpleasant, but still too fast; because who would be happy to see her if she...
arrived? And looked back with great regret at the hustle and bustle of
Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.Elizabeth's last letter had communicated news from some ...
to interest.Mr Elliot was in Bath.He had called Camden Place; had
cried a second time, a third; had been emphatically considerate.if
Elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves, had
much effort to seek knowledge and the value of the
connection, as he had previously struggled to demonstrate neglect.This was
very wonderful if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very ...
pleasant curiosity and bewilderment about Mr. Elliot, who has already recanted
the feeling she'd expressed to Mary so recently that he was "a man"
she didn't want to see."She had a great desire to see him.If he
really tried to reconcile like a dutiful branch, he must be
forgive him for breaking away from the paternal tree.Anne was not animated to an even tone by the circumstance, but she
felt she would rather see Mr. Elliot again than not, and that was more
than she could say of many other persons in Bath.She was put in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then rode up to her
private lodging, in Rivers Street.Chapter 15


Sir Walter had taken a very good home in Camden Place, an exalted one
dignified situation, as a man becomes of significance; and both he
and Elizabeth were settled there to their satisfaction.Anne entered it with a sinking heart, awaiting incarceration from
many months, and anxiously saying to himself, "Oh, when shall I leave
you again?" A certain amount of unexpected cordiality in the welcome though
she received, did her good.Her father and sister were happy to see
to show her the house and furniture, and met her
with kindness.She made a fourth when they sat down at the table
noted as an advantage.Mrs. Clay was very nice and smiled a lot, but her pleasantries and
smiles were more natural.Anne had always felt that she
would pretend what was appropriate upon her arrival, but the complaint of
the others were unexpected.They were evidently in a fine spirit,
and she soon listened to the causes.They didn't want to
listen to her.After putting down a few compliments about being deep
regretted in their old neighborhood, which Anne couldn't afford, they
only had a few vague questions to ask before the conversation was all about it
their own.Uppercross aroused no interest, Kellynch very little: it
was all Bath.They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than replied:
their expectations in every way.Their house was undoubtedly the
best in Camden Place; their salons had many decided advantages
about everyone else they had seen or heard, and the
superiority was no less in the style of the montage, or the taste
of the furniture.Their knowledge was extremely sought after.Everyone wanted to visit them.They had withdrawn from many
introductions, and still had cards left by people all the time
of whom they knew nothing.Here were funds of pleasure.Can Anne wonder that her father and
sister were happy? She may not wonder, but she has to sigh that
father should feel no humiliation in his change, should not take any notice of it
regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landowner, should
find so much in vain in the little ones of a city; and she must
sigh and smile, and marvel as Elizabeth de
folding doors and walked with delight from one drawing room to the
others, boast of their space; at the possibility of that woman, that
had been mistress of Kellynch Hall and found the size to be proud of
between two walls, maybe 30 feet apart.But this wasn't all they had to make them happy.They had sir
Elliot too.Anne had a lot to hear from Mr Elliot.He was not
only forgiven, they were delighted with him.He'd been about Bath
two weeks; (he had passed through Bath in November, on his way to
London, when Sir Walter's intelligence was located there
reached him, of course, though only twenty-four hours instead, but
he couldn't have used it ;) but he was now a
a fortnight in Bath, and his first goal upon his arrival was to leave
his card in Camden Place, followed by such diligent efforts
to meet, and when they met, through such openness of behavior,
such a willingness to apologize for the past, such concern to be
again as a relationship, that was their former good relationship
fully recovered.They couldn't find fault with him.He had explained everything away
appearance of neglect on his own side.It originated in
misunderstanding at all.He never had the idea to throw himself
from; he had feared that he would be thrown off, but did not know why, and
delicacy had kept him quiet.On the hint of having spoken
disrespectful or careless of the family and the family honors, he
was quite indignant.He, who once boasted that he was an Elliot, and ...
whose feelings, regarding connection, were too strict to fit the
today's unfeudal tone.He was amazed indeed, but his
character and general conduct must refute it.He could refer Mr
Walter to all who knew him; and sure, the pain he had suffered
on this, the first possibility of atonement, to be restored to the
the basis of a relationship and presumptive heir, was strong evidence of his
opinions on the subject.The circumstances of his marriage also turned out to be very open
weakening.This was an article he was not allowed to comment on himself; but
a very close friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a very respectable one
man, perfect sir (and not a bad looking man, Sir Walter
added), who lived in very good style in Marlborough Buildings, and
had been admitted to their acquaintance at his own special request
through Mr. Elliot, had mentioned one or two things regarding the ...
marriage, which made a substantial difference in discrediting it.Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot for a long time and knew him well...
with his wife, had understood the whole story perfectly.She was
certainly not a woman of a family, but well-educated, capable, rich,
and overly in love with his friend.There had been the charm.She had been looking for him.Without that allure, not all of her money would...
tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was assured of her, moreover
to have been a very fine woman.There was a lot here to ease it
company.A very fine woman with a great fortune, in love with him!
Sir Walter seemed to admit it as a full apology; and although Elizabeth
couldn't see the circumstance in such a favorable light, she ...
allowed it to be a great solution.Mr. Elliot had called repeatedly, apparently had dinner with them once
delighted at the distinction they were asked for as they did not give dinners
generally; in short, delighted with any evidence of a cousin message, and
placing his entire happiness in intimate life in Camden Place.Anne listened, but without fully understanding.Surcharges, large
the ideas of those who spoke had to be taken into account, she knew.She heard it all embellished.That all sounded extravagant or
irrational in the progress of the Atonement may have no origin
but in the language of the relators.Yet she had the
feeling that there was something more than immediately appeared, in
Mr. Elliot's wish that things get better after so many years ...
received by them.In worldly views he had nothing to gain by being
on terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk due to a state of variance.In
he was probably the richer of the two, and the Kellynch
estate would be just as sure his afterlife as the title.a sensible person,
and he had looked like a very sensible man, why should it be an object?
to him? She could only offer one solution; it might have been for
Elizabeth's sake.There used to be a real predilection,
though convenience and misfortune had otherwise attracted him; and now
that he could afford to please himself, he might intend to pay his own
addresses for her.Elizabeth was certainly very handsome, with ...
well-bred, elegant manners, and her character never would have been
penetrated by Mr. Elliot, who knew her only in public, and when he was very young
himself.How could her temper and understanding endure the examination?
of his current sharper time of life was another concern and rather a
anxious.She sincerely wished he wouldn't be too
nice, or too observant if Elizabeth was his goal; and that Elizabeth
was inclined to believe it herself, and that was her friend Mrs. Clay
encouraging the idea, seemed obvious by a glance or two between them,
while talking about Mr. Elliot's frequent visits?.Anne mentioned the glimpse she'd had of him in Lyme, but without
get a lot of attention.'Oh, yes, maybe it was Mr. Elliot.They didn't know.It could be him, maybe."They couldn't listen
to her description of him.They described him themselves; sir
Especially Walter.He did justice to his kind of gentleman
appearance, its appearance of elegance and fashion, its shapely face, its
sensible eye; but at the same time "he must very much regret his being"
under-depended, a defect whose time appeared to have increased; nor could he
pretend to say that not nearly every feature had changed for ten years
the worst.Mr. Elliot seemed to think that he (Sir Walter)...
look just like he had when they last broke up; 'but Sir Walter
could not fully answer the compliment, what had
embarrassed him.However, he did not want to complain.Mr. Elliot was
better to look at than most men, and he didn't mind being seen
everywhere with him."

Mr. Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talking about the
whole evening.Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced
to them! and Mr. Elliot so scared he should! 'and there was a lady
Wallis, at this point known to them only by description, as she was
daily expectation of her incarceration; but Mr Elliot spoke of her as "a
most charming woman, very worthy to be known in Camden Place, 'and
once she recovered, they would get to know each other.Sir Walter
thought a lot of Mrs. Wallis; she was said to be extremely beautiful
beautiful woman.'He longed to see her.He hoped she might make something
compensates for the many very simple faces he constantly
streets.The worst thing about Bath was the number of ordinary women.He did
does not mean that there were no beautiful women, but the number
plain was out of all proportion.He had often observed, as he
walked, that one pretty face would be followed by thirty, or
thirty-five startle; and once, as he had been in a shop on Bond
Street, he had counted eighty-seven women passing by one after the other,
without a bearable face in between.It had been cold
morning, to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly a woman in one
a thousand could pass the test.But there were definitely some
horrible multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men! they
were infinitely worse.Such scarecrows when the streets were crowded!
It was obvious how little the women were used to seeing
tolerable, by the effect produced by a man of decent appearance.He
had never walked arm in arm with Colonel Wallis (who was a
fine military figure, though gritty) without noticing any
the woman's eye was upon him; every woman's eye was certainly on Colonel
Valais."Humble Sir Walter! But he was not allowed to escape".His daughter and Mrs. Clay suggested that Colonel Wallis'...
companion could have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis, and certainly
wasn't sandy."What does Mary look like?" said Sir Walter, in the height of his good
Humour."Last I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope so dat
may not happen every day."

"Oh no, that must have been quite a coincidence.In general she has been
in very good health and looking very good since Michaelmas."

"If I thought it wouldn't tempt her to go out in high winds and grow...
rude I would send her a new hat and pelisse."

Anne considered whether she should venture to suggest that a dress,
or a cap, would not be subject to such misuse if a knock on the
door suspended everything.'A knock on the door! And so late! It was
ten o'clock.Could it be Mr. Elliot? They knew he would dine in
Lansdown Crescent.It was possible that he stopped on the way home
to ask how they did it.They couldn't think of anyone else.Mrs Clay
definitely thought it was Mr. Elliot's knock."Mrs. Clay was right.With everything
the condition that a butler and footboy could give, Mr Elliot was ushered in
in the room.It was the same, same man, with no difference whatsoever, but of clothes.Anne recoiled a little while the others received his compliments, and
her sister apologize for calling at such an unusual hour, but "he
couldn't be so close without wanting to know neither she nor she
friend had gotten cold the day before, "& c.&c; that was all like
done politely and as polite as possible, but her share must
then follow.Sir Walter spoke of his youngest daughter; "Mr. Elliot
must give him permission to present him to his youngest daughter '(there was
no opportunity to remember Mary); and Anne, smiling and blushing, very
decently, Mr. Elliot showed the beautiful features he didn't have by a long shot
means forget, and saw it right away, amused at its small start
amazed that he had been completely unaware of who she was.He
looked utterly amazed, but no more surprised than pleased; to be
eyes brightened! and with the most perfect enthusiasm he welcomed the
relationship, hinted at the past, and requested to be received as one
knowledge already.He was just as handsome as he had appeared
in Lyme, his expression improved by speaking, and so did his manners
exactly what they should be, so polished, so easy, so special
pleasant that she could compare them in excellence with just one
the manners of the person.They weren't the same, but they were, perhaps,
equally good.He sat down with them and greatly improved their conversation.There could be no doubt that he was a wise man.Ten minutes were
enough to confirm that.His tone, his expressions, his choice
subject, know where to stop; it was all the operation of a
sensible, discerning mind.As soon as he could, he started talking to…
hair from Lyme, who wanted to compare opinions about the place, but
especially want to talk about the circumstance of their happening with?
being guests at the same inn at the same time; to give its own route,
understand something about her, and regret that he should have lost something like that
a chance to pay his respects to her.She gave him a short circuit
report of her party and company at Lyme.His regret increased as he
listened.He had spent all his lonely evening in the room
adjacent theirs; had heard voices, mirth constantly; thought she
must be a lovely bunch of people, longing to be with them, but
certainly without the slightest suspicion that he possesses the shadow
of the right to introduce oneself.If only he had asked who the party was?
goods! The name Musgrove would have told him enough."Well, it
would serve to cure him of an absurd habit of never having one
question in an inn which he had adopted when he was a young man
the main thing is that it is very naughty to be curious?.“The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty,” he said, “about
what it takes in ways to make him quite the thing is more
absurd, I think, than that of any other set of beings in the world.The folly of the means they often use is matched only by the
foolishness of what they have in mind."

But he shouldn't just turn his thoughts to Anne: he knew ...
it; he was soon scattered again among the others, and it was only on
intervals that he could return to Lyme.His research, however, produced a detailed account of the scene she was in
was engaged there, shortly after he left the place.to have
hinted at 'an accident', he needs to hear the whole.When he inquired,
Sir Walter and Elizabeth also began to wonder, but the difference in...
their manner could not be inconspicuous.She could only compare
Mr Elliot for Lady Russell, desiring to really understand what was there
passed, and to the degree of concern about what she must have suffered
to witness it.He stayed with them for an hour.The elegant clock on the mantelpiece
had struck "elf with his silver tones", and the watchman was
started hearing the same story from a distance, before Mr
Elliot or any of them seemed to sense he had been there a long time.Anne could not have imagined that her first evening inside
Camden Place could have passed so well!



Chapter 16


There was a point that Anne would have upon returning to her family
have been more grateful to establish it, even than Mr. Elliot being in love?
with Elizabeth, what was, her father is not in love with madam
Clay; and she was far from easy when she had been there
at home for a few hours.When she went down to breakfast the next morning,
found out there had just been some decent pretense on the lady side
want to leave them.She could imagine Mrs. Clay saying that…
"Now that Miss Anne was here, she couldn't imagine being wanted at all;"
for Elizabeth answered in a whisper, “It mustn't be there
reason indeed.I assure you I don't feel it.She's nothing to me
compared to you;" and she was full time to hear her father say:
'My dear madam, this must not be so.You haven't seen anything yet
bath.You have only been here to be useful.You can't run away
from us now.You must stay to meet Mrs Wallis, the
beautiful Mrs. Wallis.For your fine mind I know the sight of
beauty is a real satisfaction."

He spoke and looked so serious that Anne was not surprised
watch Mrs. Clay take a look at Elizabeth and herself.Her
facial expression might express some vigilance; but the praise
of the fine spirit seemed to stir no thought in her sister.The
lady couldn't help but give in to such joint supplications, and promised to stay.In the course of that same morning, Anne and her father had the opportunity to
only together did he begin to compliment her on her improved appearance; he
found her 'less skinny in her person, in her cheeks, her skin, hair
complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.Had she used something?
thing in particular? '' No nothing."" Gowland only, "he supposed ...."No, nothing at all"."" Ha! he was amazed at that; "and added:
“Surely you can't do better than continue as you are; you can't
be better than good; or I should recommend Gowland, the constant use of
Gowland, during the spring months.Mrs. Clay used it on me
recommendation, and you see what it did for her.you see how it is
has carried away her freckles."

If only Elizabeth could have heard this! Such personal praise could
affected her, especially because it didn't seem to Anne that the
freckles were completely reduced.But everything has to take its chance.The harm of marriage would be much less if Elizabeth were too
Marry.As for herself, she could always lead a house with Lady
Russell.Lady Russell's calm mind and polite manners were put to the test
at this point, in her community in Camden Place.The sight of madam
Clay who was in that favor, and Anne's so overlooked, was an eternal person
provocation for her there; and annoyed her just as much when she was gone, as a...
person in Bath who drinks the water, gets all new publications, and
has a great knowledge, has time to be tormented.As Mr. Elliot got to know her, she became more charitable, or more...
indifferent, towards the others.His manners were an instant
recommendation; and when she spoke to him she found the solid matter so complete
the superficial support, that's what she was initially, as she told Anne,
almost ready to exclaim, "Could this be Mr. Elliot?" and couldn't
seriously imagine a more pleasant or honorable man.Everything united in him; good understanding, right opinions,
knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.He had strong feelings of
kinship and family honour, without pride or weakness; he
lived with the generosity of a man of fortune, without ostentation; he
condemned for himself in all that is essential, without defying the public
view at every point of worldly decorum.He was steady, observant,
moderate, frank; never run away with ghosts or selfishness,
who felt strongly; and yet, with a sensitivity to
which was amiable and lovely, and a value for all congratulations from
domestic life, the characters of which were of enthusiasm and violent
agitation rarely owns real.She was sure he hadn't been
happy in marriage.Colonel Wallis said it, and Lady Russell saw it;
but it had not been an accident to sour his mind, nor (she started off nicely ...
suspect soon) to prevent him from thinking of a second choice.Her
Mr. Elliot's satisfaction outweighed Mrs. Clay's plague.It had been a few years now that Anne began to learn that she and she
an excellent friend might think otherwise at times; and it didn't
therefore surprise her that Lady Russell wouldn't see anything
suspicious or inconsistent, nothing that requires more motives than
appeared, in Mr Elliot's great desire for reconciliation.In Lady
Russell's opinion it was perfectly natural that Mr. Elliot was an adult
time of life, it should feel like a very desirable object, and what would
generally recommend him among all sensible people to be good
conditions with the head of his family; the easiest process in the world of
time on a naturally clear head, and wander alone in the heyday of
youth.However, Anne assumed she was still smiling, and finally too
stated "Elizabeth.Lady Russell listened and watched, and only made ...
this cautious answer: - "Elizabeth! very well, time will explain."

It was a reference to the future, which Anne after a while
observation, felt she had to submit to.She couldn't decide
Gift.In that house, Elizabeth must be first; and she was in the
custom of such a general celebration as "Miss Elliot", that every
particularity of attention seemed almost impossible.Mr Elliot too,
It should be borne in mind, had not been a widower for seven months.A little
delay on his part would be highly excusable.Anne could never really do that
see the mourning band around his hat, without fear that it was her
unpardonable, attributing to him such imaginations; for though
his marriage hadn't been very happy, but there were so many
years that they have a very rapid recovery of the
terrible impression that it has been solved.However it ended, he was without a doubt their most pleasant aangenaam
acquaintance in Bath: she saw none equal to him; and it was great
occasional pleasure to talk to him about Lyme, which he seemed to do
have as vivid a desire to see again and see more of as they do.They went through many of the details of their first meeting
times.He made her understand that he had looked at her with some
seriousness.She knew well; and she remembered someone else's
look also.They didn't always think the same.Its value for rank and belonging they
observed was larger than hers.It wasn't just satisfaction, it was
must be a fondness for the cause, which made him warm inside her
father and sister's concerns about a subject she considered unworthy
to excite them.The Bath newspaper announced the arrival of
the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and her daughter, the Honorable
Miss Carteret; and all the comfort of No.-, Camden Place, was swept
many days away; for the Dalrymples (according to Anne most
unfortunately) were cousins ​​of the Elliots; and the pain was how to?
introduce yourself well.Anne had never seen her father and sister in contact with
nobility, and she must admit that she is disappointed.She had hoped
better things from their high ideas about their own situation in life, and
was reduced to a wish she had never foreseen; a wish that
they had more pride; for "our cousins ​​Lady Dalrymple and Miss
Carteret; ""our cousins, the Dalrymples," rang in her ears all day long
long.Sir Walter had once been in the company of the late Viscount, but that had happened
never saw anyone from the rest of the family; and the difficulties of the
case arose because there had been a suspension of all sexual intercourse by
letters of ceremony, since the death of that said deceased viscount,
when, due to a dangerous illness of Sir Walter at the same time
time there was an unfortunate omission at Kellynch.Not a letter from
condolence had been sent to Ireland.The neglect had been visited
the sinner's head; because when poor Lady Elliot herself died, no
A letter of condolence was received at Kellynch, and therefore also there
was but too much reason to believe that the Dalrymples de
relationship as closed.How to set up this fearful business?
rights, and being admitted as cousins ​​again, the question was: and it was
a question that, in a more rational way, neither Lady Russell nor
Mr Elliot thought it was unimportant."Family ties were always worth it
conservative, good company that is always worth seeking out; Lady Dalrymple
a house, for three months, in Laura Place, and was going to live in it
style.She'd been in Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had ...
heard her speak like a charming woman.That was very desirable
the connection should be renewed, if it could be done, without any
compromise of decency on the Elliots' side."

Sir Walter, however, would choose his own means and finally wrote:
very fine letter with detailed explanation, regret and supplication to his
right dear nephew.Neither Lady Russell nor Mr. Elliot could do that
admire the letter; but it did all it took, bringing three
Dowager Viscountess's doodle rules."She was very much
honored, and should be happy in their knowledge." The toil of the
business was over, the candies had begun.They visited in Laura Place,
they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple and the Honorable
Miss Carteret, arrange where they are most visible: and
"Our Cousins ​​at Laura Place," - "Our Cousin, Lady Dalrymple and Miss
Carteret, 'was discussed with everyone.Anne was ashamed.Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been very bad?
pleasant, she would still have been ashamed of the excitement they had
made, but they were nothing.There was no superiority of manner,
achievement or understanding.Lady Dalrymple had been given the name
of 'a charming woman', because she had a smile and a polite answer to...
everyone.Miss Carteret, with even less to say, was so clear and so
awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place but
before her birth.Lady Russell confessed that she had expected something better; but still "it is
was an acquaintance worth having;" and when Anne dared to speak to her...
opinion about them to Mr Elliot, he agreed they had nothing in it
themselves, but still insisted that, as a family bond, as well
company, such as those who would gather good company around them
their value.Anne smiled and said:

"My idea of ​​good company, Mr. Elliot, is the company of smart,
knowledgeable people who have a lot of conversations; that is
what I call good company."

"You're mistaken," he said gently, "that's not good company; that's ...
best.Good company requires only birth, education and manners,
and regarding education it is not very nice.Birth and good manners
are essential; but learning a little is certainly not dangerous
in good company; on the contrary, it will do very well.My cousin Anne
shakes her head.She is not satisfied.she is picky.My dear
cousin "(sits down next to her)," you have a better right to be
picky than almost every other woman I know; but will it answer?
Will it make you happy? Wouldn't it be wiser to society of
those good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the benefits of the
connection as much as possible? You can trust they will
move this winter in the first set in bath, and since rank is rank, your
known to be related to them will be of use in solving your
family (say our family) to the degree of attention that we die
must all wish."

'Yes,' Anne sighed, 'we shall indeed be known as related to them!'
then she remembered and didn't want to be answered, she added:
"I definitely think that far too much effort has gone into…
acquainted.I guess "(smiling)" I'm more proud than that
Each of you; but I must confess it annoys me that we should be like this
worried about getting the relationship acknowledged, which we can be really bad
is certainly a matter of complete indifference to them."

“Excuse me dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.In London,
maybe, in your current quiet way of life, it could be like you say:
but in Bad; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth your while
knowing: always acceptable as knowledge."

'Well,' said Anne, 'I am certainly proud, too proud to welcome
which depends entirely on location."

"I love your indignation," he said; "it is very natural.But here you
are in Bath, and the target should be located here with all...
honor and dignity that should belong to Sir Walter Elliot.YOU
talk about being proud; I'm called proud, I know, and I won't wish for it
believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if examined, would have done
the same object, I have no doubt about that, although it may seem kind of like
different.On one point I am sure, my dear cousin," (he continued,
lower speaking, although there was no one else in the room) "in one
point, i'm sure we should feel the same way.We must feel that every addition
for your father's society, among his equals or superiors, may be of use
by diverting his thoughts from those under him."

As he spoke, he looked at the chair where Mrs. Clay had been lately...
occupy: a sufficient explanation of what he specifically meant; and
though Anne couldn't believe they had the same kind of pride,
she was glad he didn't like Mrs. Clay; and her conscience
admitted that his desire to promote her father is going to be great
knowledge was more than excusable in the eyes of beating her.Chapter 17


While Sir Walter and Elizabeth worked diligently
fortune in Laura Place, Anne renewed an acquaintance of a very...
other description.She had appealed to her former governess, and heard of her there
as an old schoolboy in Bath who the two had strong claims to
her attention to past kindness and current suffering.Miss Hamilton,
now Mrs. Smith had shown kindness during one of those times of hers
life when it had been most valuable.Anne had gone to school unhappy,
mourning the loss of a mother she loved dearly,
her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen, from
strong sensitivity and not cheerfulness, must suffer at such a time;
and Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the
lack of close relations and a permanent home, another year at
school, had been useful and good to her in a way significantly
lessened her misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.Miss Hamilton had left school, was married not long after, was
said she was married to a man of fortune, and this was all Anne had ...
known of her, hitherto that the report of their governess brought her
situation emerges in a more decided but very different form.She was a widow and poor.Her husband had been extravagant; and on his
death, about two years before, had left his business terribly
concerned.She had had all kinds of difficulties to contend with, and
besides this suffering was a serious one
rheumatic fever, which had finally lowered her legs, had caused her
the present a cripple.She had come to Bath for that reason, and was ...
now in lodgings near the hot pools, living in a very humble way, unable
even to afford himself the comfort of a servant, and of course almost
excluded from society.Their mutual friend replied for the satisfaction that a visit from
Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore lost no time
to go.She said nothing about what she had heard or what she had heard
intended, at home.It wouldn't arouse any real interest there.She alone
consulted Lady Russell, who went deeply into her feelings, and
was only too happy to bring her as close to Mrs. Smith's shelter as possible ...
Westgate buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.The visit was made, their acquaintance restored, their interest
into each other more than re-ignited.The first ten minutes were over
clumsiness and his emotion.Twelve years had passed since they did that
divorced, and each presented a slightly different person from what the
others thought.Twelve years had Anne changed from the bloom,
quiet, shapely girl of fifteen, to the elegant little woman of...
twenty-seven, with all beauty but bloom, and with manners like
consciously right because they were invariably gentle; and had twelve years
transformed the good-looking, mature Miss Hamilton into all the brilliance
of health and confidence of superiority, in a poor, weak, helpless
widow, who received the visit of her former protégé as a favor; but everything
that was uncomfortable in the meeting was soon passed, and left
only the interesting charm of remembering past partialities and
talk about old times.Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and pleasant manners she had
almost dared to depend on, and have a tendency to converse and be
excited beyond her expectations.Nor the dissipations of the
past - and she had lived a great deal in the world - nor the limitations of
the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her down
heart or ruin her mind.On a second visit, she spoke with great openness, and
Anne's surprise increased.She could hardly imagine anymore
desolate situation in itself than that of Mrs Smith.She had been very fond of
of her husband: she had buried him.She was used to prosperity:
it was gone.She did not have a child to connect her with life and happiness
again, no relationships to help sort out tangled affairs,
no health to make everything else bearable.Her accommodations were
confined to a noisy drawing room, and a dark bedroom behind it, with no
possibility to go from one to another without help, whichever
there was only one servant in the house to afford it, and she never did
left the house but to be transported in the warm bath.Still, despite
of all this, Anne had reason to believe she only had a few moments of it
lethargy and depression, to hours of activity and pleasure.How
could it be? She watched, observed, reflected and finally determined
that this was not just a matter of constancy or resignation.A
submissive spirit could be patient, strong understanding would suffice
resolution, but here was a little more; this was the elasticity of it
mind, that tendency to be comforted, that power to turn around easily
from bad to good, and from finding work that will take her out of the
himself, who came only from nature.It was the finest gift of all
Sky; and Anne considered her friend to be one of those cases where,
by a merciful agreement it seems designed to almost counterbalance
any other will.There had been a time, Mrs. Smith told her, when her spirit was running low
failed.She couldn't call herself an invalid now, compared to her
stands upon the first reaching of Bath.She was indeed a pity
object; for she had caught a cold during the journey and had hardly taken it
possession of her home before she had to be confined to her bed again and
suffer from severe and constant pain; and all this among strangers,
with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances with it
particularly unsuitable at that time to bear extraordinary costs.They
had endured it though and could really say it had done her
good.It had increased her comfort by making her feel like she was
in good hands.She had seen too much of the world to see sudden or ...
disinterested attachment everywhere, but her illness had proved her
that her landlady had a character to keep, and would not use her haar
sick; and she had been extremely lucky with her nurse, as a sister
from her landlady, a nurse by profession, and who always had a home in
that house when he was unemployed happened to be free just in time to
attend her.'And she,' said Mrs. Smith, 'besides taking care of me most ...
admirable, has truly proved invaluable knowledge.As fast as me
could use my hands she taught me to knit which was great
entertainment; and she got in the way of making this little one
wire cases, pincushions and card racks, you will always find them with me
busy, and which give me the means to do a little good goed
to one or two very poor families in this neighborhood.She had a
great knowledge, of course professional, among those who can
afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.She always takes
the right time to apply.Everyone's heart is open, you know, when
they have recently escaped severe pain, or are recovering from the
blessing of health, and nurse Rooke understands very well when
to speak.She is a smart, intelligent, sensible woman.Hers is a line
for seeing human nature; and she has a fund of common sense and
observation, which makes her infinitely superior as a companion
thousands of those who have only 'the best education in the'
world, 'knows nothing worth paying attention to.Call it gossip if you want
but if Sister Rooke has half an hour of free time to give to me, so is she
sure to have something to say that is entertaining and profitable:
something that helps a person get to know his kind better.People like to hear
what's going on, to be aware of the newest forms of being?
insignificant and stupid.For me, who lives so much alone, her conversation, me
assure you, its a treat."

Anne, far from wanting to scold at the pleasure, replied, "I can easily ...
believe it.Women of that class have great opportunities, and if so
being intelligent may be worth listening to.Such varieties of
human nature as they are accustomed to witness! And that's not it
only in its follies, that they be well read; because they see it
occasionally under any circumstance that may be most interesting or
to influence.What examples should pass them by of fiery,
disinterested, self-denying attachment, heroism, steadfastness,
patience, resignation: from all conflict and all sacrifice
that ennoble us the most.A sickroom often provides the value of
volumes."

"Yes," said Mrs. Smith, more doubtfully, "sometimes it can, although I'm scared
the lessons are not often in the lofty style you describe.here and
there human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally
speaking, it is his weakness and not his strength that appears in one
sickroom: it is more selfishness and impatience than generosity
and steadfastness, one hears that hoort.There is so little true friendship
in the world! and alas" (speaking low and trembling) "there
there are so many who forget to think seriously until it is almost too late."

Anne saw the misery of such feelings.The man was not what he was
and the woman was led among that part of humanity that made
she thought worse about the world than she hoped it deserved.It was only one
However, passing on emotion with Mrs. Smith; she shook it off, and soon
added in another tone--

"I don't think the situation my friend Mrs. Rooke is in right now,
will yield a lot to interest or build me up.She's only breastfeeding
Mrs. Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; just a beautiful, silly, expensive,
fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to say
but from side and decoration.I want to make a profit on Mrs Wallis,
however.She has plenty of money, and I intend she will buy it all
expensive things I now have in my hands."

Anne had called her friend several times, about the existence of ...
such a person was known in Camden Place.Finally it became necessary
to talk about her.Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs. Clay returned one
morning of Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple
for the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that
evening at Westgate Buildings.She didn't regret the excuse.They
was only asked, she was sure, for Lady Dalrymple was being held
home due to a bad cold, was happy to take advantage of the relationship that had
so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account with much
enthusiasm - 'She was engaged to spend the evening with an old man
schoolmate."They weren't very interested in anything related to"
Anna; but still enough questions were asked to make it
understood what this old schoolmate was; and Elizabeth was
disdainfully, and Sir Walter stern."Westgate Buildings!" he said, "and who will be Miss Anne Elliot?
visiting Westgate Buildings? A Mrs. Smith.A widow, Mrs. Smith; and
who was her husband? One of the five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are
be met everywhere.And what is its appeal? That she is old
and sickly.At my word, Miss Anne Elliot, you have the most
extraordinary taste! Anything that revolts other people, low
company, meager rooms, filthy air, disgusting associations invite you
to you.But you can certainly postpone this old lady until tomorrow: she
is not so close to her end I suppose, but may she hope to see another
day.What is her age? Forty?"

“No, sir, she's not even an hour and a half, but I don't think I can postpone it
my engagement, because it's the only night for some time that will do that
fit right in with her and myself.She's going into the warm bath tomorrow,
and for the rest of the week, you know, we're engaged."

"But what does Lady Russell think of this knowledge?" asked
Elizabeth."She can't fault it," Anne replied; "on the contrary, they
approves, and has generally taken me when I see Ms
Smith."

“Westgate Buildings must have been quite surprised by its appearance
of a carriage set up close to the sidewalk, ”noted Sir Walter.Sir
Indeed, Henry Russell's widow has no honor to discern her arms,
yet it is a clever outfit, and it is undoubtedly well known
convey a Miss Elliot.A widow, Mrs. Smith, is staying at Westgate Buildings!
A poor widow who can barely live, between thirty and forty; an ordinary lady
Smith, an everyday Mrs. Smith, of all the people and all the names in the
world, to be Miss Anne Elliot's chosen girlfriend, and to be preferred
by her to her own family ties among the nobility of England and
Ireland! Mrs. Smith! Such a name! "

Mrs. Clay, who had been there while this was all over, now thought it ...
advisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said a lot, and did
long to say a little in defense of her boyfriend is not very unequal
claims theirs, but her sense of personal respect for her father
prevented her.She didn't answer.She left it to herself to
remember that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between her thirties
and forty, with little to live on, and no surname of dignity.Anne kept her agreement; the others loved theirs, and of course they
heard the next morning that they had had a wonderful evening.She had
was the only one absent from the set, for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had Elizabeth
not only had herself been fully employed by her ladyship, but had
was actually happy to be used by her in the collection of others, and it was
have taken the trouble to invite both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot; and mr
Elliot had made every effort to leave Colonel Wallis and Lady early
Russell had arranged all of her evening appointments to wait
on her.Anne had the whole history of everything such an evening could do
delivery from Lady Russell.For her, her main interest must be, in
much has been said about it between her boyfriend and Mr. Elliot; in
wished, regretted and honored at the same time
stay away in such a case.Her friendly, compassionate visits to this
old schoolmate, sick and diminished, seemed to have mister very happy
Elliot.He thought she was a very special young woman; in her
mood, manners, spirit, a model of feminine excellence.He could meet
even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits; and Anne couldn't be
given so much to understand by her friend, she couldn't know she was
so highly valued by a sensible man, without much of that pleasant
sensations her friend wanted to create.Lady Russell was now quite decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot.She was as convinced of his intention to win Anne in time as he was of his
earned her, and began to calculate the number of weeks that
free him from all remaining restrictions of widowhood, and
release him to exercise his most open powers to please.They
wouldn't talk to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the
subject, she would venture on little more than hints of what might be
hereafter, of a possible attachment to his side, of the desirability
of the alliance, assuming that such attachment is real and returns.Anne heard her and made no violent exclamations; she just smiled,
blushed and gently shook her head.“I'm not a matchmaker, as you well know,” said Lady Russell, “because I'm a lot
too aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations.I mean that only if Mr. Elliot paid his addresses some time later
for you, and if you'd be inclined to accept him, I think there are
would be every possibility to be happy together.One most
suitable connection everyone should consider it, but i think it could be
a very happy one."

“Mr. Elliot is an extremely pleasant man, and in many ways I am
think highly of him," said Anne; "but we wouldn't fit...."

Lady Russell let this pass, saying only in rejoinder: "I own that
consider you as Kellynch's future mistress, the future
Lady Elliot, to see and see you occupy your dear mother's
place, succeeding in all its rights, and all its popularity, as well
for all its virtues, would be the greatest satisfaction to me.You are your mother's self in countenance and character; and if i
may you like the way she was, in situation and name,
and home, presiding and blessing in the same place, and only superior to
hair is more appreciated! My dear Anne, it would give me
more joy than is often felt in my time of life! "

Anne had to turn away, get up, walk to a table in the distance,
and, leaning there in pretended work, try to restrain the feelings
this photo excited.Just her fantasy and her heart
were enchanted.The idea of ​​becoming what her mother had been; from
having the precious name of "Lady Elliot" revived in herself for the first time; from
returned to Kellynch, call it her home again, her home for
once, was a charm she couldn't immediately resist.Lady Russell
did not say a word, willing to abandon the matter
operation; and believing that, at that point, Mr. Elliot would be with ...
decency has spoken for itself! - she believed, in short, what Anne
did not believe geloof.The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himself
calmed Anne down.Kellynch and "Lady
Elliot "faded all.She could never accept him.And it wasn't
only that her feelings were still unfavorable to every man but one; her
judgment, on the basis of serious consideration of the possibilities of such
case was against Mr Elliot.Although they had known each other for a month, she couldn't be satisfied tevreden
that she really knew his character.That he was a wise man, and
a pleasant man that he spoke well, expressed good opinions, seemed
judge well and as a principled man this was all clear enough.He knew for sure what was right, and she couldn't fix a single article either
of moral duty manifestly violated; but still she would have been
afraid to be held accountable for his behavior.She distrusted the past, if not it
Gift.The names of former employees, the
allusions to past practices and occupations, but not suggested conjectures
favorable to what he had been.She saw that something had been bad
habits; that traveling on Sundays had been commonplace; that there was
was a period of his life (and probably not a short one) when he
at the very least have been careless in all serious matters; and, though he might
now think very differently, who could answer the true feelings of?
a smart, careful man, old enough to appreciate a fair
character? How could it ever be established that his mind was real?
cleaned?

Mr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he wasn't open.Over there
was never a burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or joy,
to the evil or good of others.This was a decision for Anne
imperfection.Her early impressions were incurable.She appreciated the
outspoken, candid, eager character above all others.Warmth
and enthusiasm still captivated her.She felt she could
much more depends on the sincerity of those who sometimes watched or
said something careless or hasty, than of those whose presence of mind
never varied, whose tongue never slipped.Mr Elliot was too generally pleasant.Different, just like the moods
her father's house, he liked them all.He endured it too well, it said
too good with any body.He had spoken to her with a degree of…
openness of Mrs. Clay; turned up all the way to see what Mrs. Clay was...
round, and despise her; and yet Mrs. Clay found him to be...
pleasant as any body.Lady Russell saw less or more than her young friend, for she saw…
nothing to arouse suspicion.She couldn't imagine a man more precisely
what he should be than Mr. Elliot; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter
then feel the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved
Anne at Kellynch Church, over the next fall.Chapter 18


It was early February; and Anne, after a month in
Bath, got very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme.They
wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated.It was three
weeks ago she had heard anything at all.She only knew that Henrietta was there
home again; and that Louisa, though considered to be recovering quickly,
was still in Lyme; and she thought very intensely about them all
evening, when a thicker than usual letter from Mary was delivered to ...
her; and, to hasten the fun and surprise, with Admiral and Mrs
Croft's compliments.The Crofts must be in Bath! A circumstance to interest her.They were
people to whom her heart turned very naturally."What is this?" exclaimed Sir Walter.'Have the Crofts arrived in Bath?
The Crofts hiring Kellynch? What have they brought you?"

"A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir."

"Oh! Those letters are handy passports.They secure a
introduction.However, I should have visited Admiral Croft at any time?
rate.I know what my tenant owes."

Anne couldn't listen anymore; she hadn't even been able to tell the poor how
The admiral's complexion escaped; her letter captivated her.It was
started a few days ago."February 1.'My dear Anne - I do not apologize for my silence, because I know how
little people think of letters in a place like Bath.You must be one
too happy for Uppercross, who, as you know,
offers little to write about.We had a very boring Christmas; mr
and Mrs Musgrove didn't have one dinner all holiday.I do
don't think of the Hayters as anyone.However, the holiday is over
last: I believe no children have ever had such long ones.I'm sure I had
not.The house was vacated yesterday, except for little Harvilles;
but you'll be surprised to hear they never went home.Mrs
Harville must be a strange mother to be separated from them for so long.I do not do
Understand it.In my opinion they are not nice kids at all; but
Mrs. Musgrove seems to like them just as well, if not better, than her
grandchildren.What terrible weather we had! It may not be felt
in Bath, with your beautiful sidewalks; but in the land it belongs to some
consequence.I haven't called a creature on me since the second time
week in January, except for Charles Hayter, who had called a lot
more often than was welcome.I think it's a shame among each other
Henrietta did not stay in Lyme as long as Louisa; it would have stayed
her a bit out of the way.The carriage is gone today
Louisa and the Harvilles tomorrow.We are not asked to dine with us
them, however, until the day after, Mrs. Musgrove is so afraid of her
being tired from the journey, which is unlikely given the fact
the care that will be taken for her; and it would be much more
convenient for me to have dinner there tomorrow?.I'm glad you found Mr. Elliot
so pleasant, and wish I could get to know him too; but I have
my usual luck: I am always out of the way when something is desirable
going on; always the last of my family to be noticed.What a huge
time Mrs. Clay stays with Elizabeth! Does she never mean that?
go away? But maybe if she left the room empty we might ...
not be invited.Let me know what you think about this.I do not expect
my kids to be asked you know.I can leave them at the Big House
very good, for a month or six weeks.I have heard at this point that the
Crofts move to Bath almost immediately; they think the admiral
gout.Charles heard it quite by accident; they have the. not had
courtesy to give me some notice, or to offer to take something.I do
don't think they improve at all as neighbors.we don't see it,
and this is truly an example of gross inattention.Charles comes to sit with me
in love, and all the good.With affection,

"Mary M ---."I am sorry to say that I am far from well; and Jemima has just…
told me the butcher says there is a lot of sore throat
about.Dare I say I'll catch it; and my sore throat, you know, are
always worse than anyone else's."


Thus the first part ended in a
envelope, with almost as much more.“I kept my letter open so I could tell you how Louisa gave birth to her
trip, and now I am extremely happy that I did as I have a lot to add.First, I got a note from Mrs. Croft yesterday, with an offer to
do you convey something; a very nice, friendly note indeed, addressed to
me, as it should be; I will therefore be able to make my letter as
as long as I want.The admiral doesn't seem very ill, and I sincerely
hope that Bath will do him all he wants.I will be really happy about it
got them back.Our neighborhood cannot miss such a pleasure
family.But now for Louisa.I have something to communicate that wants
don't be a little surprised.She and the Harvilles came all Tuesday
safe, and in the evening we went to ask her how she was, when we ...
kinda surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party as he had ...
invited as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think it was?
reason? No more and no less than that he was in love with Louisa, and
didn't choose to venture Uppercross until he got an answer from Mr
Musgrove; because it was all settled between him and her before she came
away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.Right, on
my honor! Aren't you surprised? In any case, I'd be surprised if
you ever got a hint of it because I never did.Mrs Musgrove protests
solemn that she knew nothing about it.We are all very good
satisfied however, for although it is not equal to her marrying captain
Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter; and Mr. Musgrove
has written his consent, and today Captain Benwick is expected.Mrs
Harville says her husband values ​​his poor sister's very much
account; but Louisa is a big favorite with both.Indeed,
Mrs. Harville and I totally agree that we love her all the better
groomed her.Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say; but if
remember, I never thought he was attached to Louisa; I've never been able to see
some of it.And this is the end, you see, of Captain Benwick
supposed to be an admirer of yours.How could Charles take such a thing?
something in his head was always incomprehensible to me.i hope he
will be more pleasant now.Certainly not a good match for Louisa
Musgrove, but a million times better than marrying the Hayters."


Mary need not have feared that her sister was prepared to any degree
The news.She had never been so surprised in her life.Captain
Benwick and Louisa Musgrove! It was almost too wonderful to believe
and it was with the greatest effort that she could stay in the room,
keep an air of calm and answer the frequently asked questions of the
moment.Luckily for her there weren't many.Sir Walter wanted
know if the Crofts traveled with four horses, and if they ...
were probably located in such a part of Bath as would suit Miss
Elliot and herself to visit; but didn't have much curiosity."How is Mary?" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer, "And
pray what brings the Crofts to Bath? "

"They come on the account of the admiral".He is thought to be gout."

"Gout and Decay!" said Sir Walter."Poor old gentleman."

"Do they have any knowledge here?" Elizabeth asked.“I don't know, but I can hardly imagine it in Admiral Croft's time
of life, and in his profession, he should not have much knowledge of it
a place like this."

'I suspect,' said Sir Walter coolly, 'Admiral Croft will be the best
known in Bath as the tenant of Kellynch Hall.Elizabeth, may we
will you dare to present him and his wife in Laura Place? "

"Oh no! I don't think so.Located as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins,
we have to be very careful not to embarrass her with her knowledge
may not approve.If we weren't related, it wouldn't mean anything; but
as cousins, she would feel scrupulous about any suggestion from us.We
better leave the Crofts to find their own level.There are several
strange looking men walking around here, who, I've been told, are sailors.The
Crofts will deal with them."

This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth's part in the letter;
when Mrs. Clay had brought her tribute of more decent attention, in a...
inquiry about Mrs. Charles Musgrove and her lovely sons, Anne was
in freedom.In her own room she tried to understand.Maybe Charles wonders
how would Captain Wentworth feel! Maybe he had left the field
Louisa had given up, had ceased to love, had discovered that he did not love her.She couldn't bear the idea of ​​betrayal or levity or anything like that
to bad use between him and his friend.She couldn't bear that
such a friendship as theirs should be unfairly broken.Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove! The cheerful, cheerful talk
Louisa Musgrove, and the depressed, thinking, feeling, reading captain
Benwick, each seemed like anything that wouldn't suit the other.Their minds differ the most! Where could the attraction have been?
The answer quickly emerged.It had been in a situation.They had
several weeks thrown together; they lived in the same
small family party: since Henrietta has gone, they must have been
almost completely dependent on each other, and Louisa, who was just recovering
through illness, had been in an interesting state, and was Captain Benwick
not inconsolable.That was a point Anne had not been able to do
avoid earlier suspicion; and instead of reaching the same conclusion as
Mary, of the current state of affairs they served only to confirm
the idea that he had felt a little tenderness for himself.She wasn't going to get much more out of it to satisfy her though haar
vanity, than Mary could have allowed.She was convinced that every
quite pleasant young woman who had listened and seemed to feel
he would have gotten the same compliment.He had an affection
heart-.He must love someone.She saw no reason not to be happy.Louisa had a good navy
zeal to begin with, and they would soon become more similar.He would
get cheerful, and she would learn to be a lover for Scott
and Lord Byron; no, that was probably already learned; of course they do
had fallen in love with poetry.Louisa Musgrove's idea turned
in a person with literary taste, and sentimental reflection
funny, but she had no doubt that it was so.The day at Lyme, the
falling from the Cobb, could affect her health, her nerves, her
courage, her character to the end of her life, as thorough as it is
seemed to have affected her fate.The conclusion of the whole thing was that if the woman had been...
wise of Captain Wentworth's merits might prefer
another man, there was nothing in the engagement to arouse lastingly
wonder; and if Captain Wentworth didn't lose a friend because of it, sure...
nothing to regret.No, it wasn't regret that made Anne's heart beat
beat in spite of herself, bringing the color to her cheeks when
she thought of Captain Wentworth unchained and free.She had some
feelings she was ashamed to explore.They looked too much like
joy, senseless joy!

She longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place, it was ...
clear that no rumor of the news had reached them yet.'s visit
ceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove was called, and
Captain Benwick too, without even a half smile.The Crofts had put themselves in a Gay Street shelter, perfect
to the satisfaction of Sir Walter.He was not at all ashamed of the
knowledge, and indeed have thought and talked much more about
the admiral, than the admiral had ever thought or talked about him.The Crofts knew as many people in Bath as they wished, and ...
considered their dealings with the Elliots merely a matter of form,
and not least likely to give them any pleasure.They brought
with them the custom of their country to be together almost always.He was
ordered to walk to ward off the gout, and Mrs. Croft seemed to be dividing
with him in everything, and to walk for her life to do him good.Anne
she saw wherever she went.Lady Russell took her in her carriage
almost every morning, and she never neglected to think about them, and never ...
not to see them.Knowing their feelings as she did it was a great
attractive image of happiness for her.She always looked at them as...
as long as she could, she gladly understood what they could be
what they talked about as they walked in happy independence, or so
delighted to see the admiral's cordial handshake as he
met an old friend and observe their enthusiasm to talk
as they occasionally knotted the navy, Mrs Croft
who looked as intelligent and enthusiastic as all the agents around her.Anne was too busy with Lady Russell to take frequent walks
herself; but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days ...
after the Croft's arrival it seemed best to her to leave her friend, or
her friend's carriage, in the lower part of town, and return alone
to Camden Place, and as she walked down Milsom Street, she had the right thing
fortune to meet the admiral.He only stood at a
printing house, with his hands behind him, in earnest contemplation
of some print, and it could not only have passed him unseen, but was
obliged to both touch and speak to him before she could catch his
notice.However, when he saw and acknowledged her, it was over
with all his usual candor and good humor."Ha! Is it you? Thanks
you, thank you.This treats me like a friend.Here I am, you
look, staring at a picture.I can never pass this store without
stop.But what a thing is here, by way of a boat! Look at it.Have you ever seen anything like this? What kind of weird guys do you fine painters need?
to think that anyone would risk his life in such a shapeless...
old cockleshell like that? And yet two gentlemen are stuck in this
mighty at ease, and looking around at the rocks and ...
mountains, like they wouldn't be upset the next moment, which they...
must be sure.I wonder where that boat was built! "(Laughs)
warmly); 'I don't venture into a horse pond.Good,"
(turning away), "Now where are you bound? Can I go somewhere for you,
or with you? Can I be of any use? "

“None, thank you unless you want to give me the pleasure of you
companionship as our way lies together.I'm going home."


"I will, with all my heart, and beyond".Yes, yes we will
take a nice walk together, and I have something to tell you when we go
along.Take my arm there; that's right; I don't feel comfortable like
I don't have a wife there.Lord! what a boat it is! ”One last look
in the picture, when they started moving."Did you say you had something to tell me, sir?"

'Yes, I have that right now.But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden; I
will only say, "How are you?" as we pass, however.I will not stop.'How are you?' Brigden stares at anyone with me except my wife.She, poor soul, is tied to the leg.She has a blister on one of hers
heels, the size of a three shilling piece.If you're about the
street, you see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother.Shabby
guys, both! I'm glad they aren't on this side of the road.Sophie cannot bear them.They once played a pathetic trick on me: escaped
with some of my best men.I'll tell you the whole story again
time.Here come old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson.Look, he
sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he considers you my wife.Ah! the
peace has come too soon for that youngster.Poor old lord Archibald! How
do you like Bath, Miss Elliot? We like it very much.we are always
meeting some old friend; the streets full of them each
morning; sure to talk a lot; and then we'll get away from them
everything, and lock ourselves up in our shelter, and pull up our chairs, and
are as cozy as if we were with Kellynch, ay, or even like we used to be
North Yarmouth and Deal.We don't like our shelter here, all the worse, I do
can tell, to remind us of the ones we first had in North
Yarmouth.The wind is blowing through one of the cabinets at the same time
way."

When they were a bit further, Anne dared to insist again on…
what to communicate.She hoped that when she got out of Milsom Street...
to satisfy her curiosity; but she still had to wait
the admiral had decided not to start before they got the
more space and tranquility from Belmont; and because she wasn't really a lady
Croft, she should let him have his way.Once they were fair
when he ran into Belmont, he started ...

Well, now you will hear something that will surprise you.But first
You should especially tell me the name of the young lady I'm going to talk to
about.That young lady, you know, what we've all been so worried about?
in front of.The Miss Musgrove, who all this happened to....Her
First name: I always forget her first name."

Anne was ashamed to seem to understand once she really understood
did; but now she could safely name "Louisa." introduce."

“Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.I wish young ladies
did not have such a number of nice first names.I should never be outside
if they were all Sophys, or something like that?.Well this lady
Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.He was
courting her week after week.The only miracle was what they could be
waiting for, until the company got to Lyme; then it was clear
enough that they had to wait for her brain to settle down.But even
then something strange happened.Instead of
when he was staying at Lyme, he went to Plymouth, and then he went to see ...
Edward.When we got back from Minehead, he had gone to Edward's,
and he has been there ever since.We haven't seen anything from him since then
November.Not even Sophie could understand.But now is the case
took the strangest turn of all; for this young lady, the same Miss
Musgrove, instead of marrying Frederick is to marry James James
Benwick.You know James Benwick."

"A little.I'm a little familiar with Captain Benwick."

"Well, she's going to marry him".No, most likely they are already married,
because I don't know what to wait for."

“I thought Captain Benwick was a very pleasant young man,” said Anne, “and
I understand he has an excellent character."

"Oh! Yes, yes, there is not a word to be said to James Benwick.He's just a commander, it's true, made last summer, and these are bad
times to get in but he has no other fault I know of.A
excellent good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active, diligent
officer too, which may be more than you'd think before
gentle demeanor doesn't do him justice."

'You are indeed mistaken there, sir; I should never suspect a flaw
spirit of Captain Benwick's ways.I mainly thought of them
pleasant, and I will answer for it, they would generally please."

"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is kinda...
too piano for me; and though it is most likely all our partiality,
Sophie and I can't help but find Frederick's ways better than his.There is something about Frederick more to our liking."

Anne got caught.Her only intention was to oppose the overly general idea of ​​...
spirit and softness are incompatible with each other, not at all
represent Captain Benwick's manners as the best that could ...
to be possible; and after a moment's hesitation she began to say:
"I wasn't doing a comparison between the two friends," but the
Admiral interrupted her with ...

And the thing is certainly true.It's not just any gossip.We
got it from Frederick himself.His sister had a letter from him
yesterday, telling us about it, and he just had it in a ...
letter from Harville, written on the spot, from Uppercross.I stand out
they are all at Uppercross."

This was an opportunity Anne couldn't resist; she said,
therefore: 'I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of
Captain Wentworth's letter to make you and Mrs Croft special...
uncomfortable.Last fall it seemed like there was an attachment
between him and Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood
are equally worn on both sides and without violence.i hope he
letter does not breathe the spirit of a badly used man."

"Not at all, not at all; there is no oath or murmurs of ...
start to finish."

Anne looked down to hide her smile."No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has too much
mind for that.If the girl likes another guy more, then it is very fit
she should have it."

"Certainly.But what I mean is I hope there's nothing in it
Captain Wentworth's writing to make you think he is thinking ...
using himself badly by his friend, which might seem, you know, without...
it is absolutely said.I am very sorry that such
friendship as it should have existed between him and Captain Benwick
destroyed or even injured by such circumstance."

"Yes, yes, I understand you.But there's none of that
nature in the letter.He doesn't drop Benwick in the slightest;
does not say so much: 'I wonder about it, I have my own reason for it'
wonder.' No, you wouldn't guess, from his way of writing,
that he had once thought of this lady (what's her name?) for himself.He sincerely hopes that they will be happy together; and there is
nothing very relentless in that, I guess."

Anne didn't get the perfect conviction the admiral intended...
but it would have been useless to continue the investigation.She therefore contented herself with everyday remarks or silence
attention, and the admiral had it all his own way."Poor Frederick!" he said finally."Now he has to start all over again"
with someone else.I think we should take him to Bath.Sophie has to
and beg him to come to Bath.There are plenty of beautiful girls here, that's me
certainly.It makes no sense to go to Uppercross again for the others
Miss Musgrove, I think, is tailor-made by her cousin, the young pastor.To do
don't you think, Miss Elliot, we should try to get him to Bath? '



Chapter 19


While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne and his...
wish to get Captain Wentworth to Bath, was Captain Wentworth
already on the way there.Before Mrs Croft wrote, he was
arrived, and the next time Anne walked out, she saw him.Mr. Elliot was with his two cousins ​​and Mrs. Clay.they were in
Milsom Street.It started to rain, not much, but enough to take shelter
desirable for women, and sufficient to make it highly desirable for
Miss Elliot has the advantage of being brought home in Lady
Dalrymple's carriage, which was waiting some distance away; they,
Anne and Mrs. Clay therefore changed to Molland's, while Mr. Elliot
walked over to Lady Dalrymple to ask her for help.He soon joined
them again, successful of course; Lady Dalrymple would be very happy
to take them home, and would call them in a few minutes.Her ladyship's carriage was a barouche and could not carry more than four
with any comfort.Miss Carteret was with her mother; consequently it is
was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all three Camden
Place ladies.There was no doubt about Miss Elliot.Whoever
was in discomfort, it shouldn't bother her, but it took a bit of time
time to settle the point of politeness between the other two.The rain
was only a small thing, and Anne was very sincere in giving us a walk with
Mr Elliot.But the rain was only a small thing for Mrs. Clay; she would
hardly drop it, and her boots were so thick! a lot of
thicker than Miss Anne's; and, in short, her politeness has proved her
Just as eager to keep walking with Mr. Elliot as Anne could be,
and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so
determined that the others were obliged to arrange it for them; Mrs
Elliot claimed that Mrs. Clay already had a bit of a cold, and Mr...
Elliot ruled on appeal that his cousin Anne's boots were previously the…
thickest.Accordingly, Ms. Clay had been found to belong to the party in the
transport; and they had just reached this point when Anne, sitting
by the window, described, very firmly and clearly, Captain Kap
Wentworth walking down the street?.Her beginnings were noticeable only to herself; but she felt it right away
she was the biggest fool in the world, the most inexplicable and...
absurd! For a few minutes she saw nothing in front of her; it was everything
confusion.She was lost, and when she scolded her mind, she was
thought the others were still waiting for the carriage, and Mr. Elliot (always ...
willingly) heading for Union Street at the behest of Mrs
Clay.She now felt a great urge to go to the outer door; she wanted
see if it rained.Why did she have to suspect herself of another motive?
Captain Wentworth must be out of sight.She left her chair, she would
To go; one half of her shouldn't always be so much wiser than the other
half, or always the other suspect that he was worse than he was.They
would see if it rained.However, she was sent back in an instant by the
entrance from Captain Wentworth himself, amid a group of gentlemen and...
ladies, apparently his acquaintance, and who he must have joined a
slightly below Milsom Street.He was more obviously beaten and confused
by seeing her than she had ever seen before; he looked good
red.For the first time since their re-acquaintance, she felt…
that she betrayed the slightest sensitivity of the two.She had the
advantage of him in the preparation of the last moments.all the
overwhelming, dazzling, bewildering, first effects of strong surprise
were done with her.Yet she had enough to feel! It was
excitement, pain, pleasure, something between pleasure and misery.He spoke to her and then turned away.The character of his manner was
embarrassment.She couldn't have called it cold or friendly,
or something as sure as ashamed.After a short pause, however, he came to her and spoke again.Mutual inquiries on common subjects have been adopted: neither is likely
far the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continues fully sensibly
that he felt less at ease than before.They just had to be that way
a lot together, were able to talk a lot with each other
part of apparent indifference and calmness; but he couldn't
now.Time had changed him, or Louisa had changed him.There was
consciousness of some kind.He looked very good, not like him
suffered in health or mind, and he was talking about Uppercross,
of the Musgroves, yes even of Louisa, and even had a momentary look of…
his own arch significance as he called it; but still it was captain
Wentworth was ill at ease, not easy, unable to pretend it was him.It wasn't surprising, but it hurt Anne to see this Elizabeth
wouldn't know him.She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw...
him, that there was full inner recognition on every side; she was
convinced that he was ready to be recognized as an acquaintance,
expected it, and she was in pain to see her sister turn away
unchanging cold.Lady Dalrymple's carriage, for which Miss Elliot grew very much
impatient, now lined up; the servant came in to announce it.It was
it started to rain again, and all in all there was a delay, and one
hustle and bustle, and make a talk, which all the small crowd in the store must make
understand that Lady Dalrymple called to transfer Miss Elliot....Bee
last Miss Elliot and her girlfriend, unsupervised but by the servant, (for
no cousin had returned), ran away; and Captain Wentworth,
as she looked at them, she turned to Anne again, and in a way, instead of words,
offered her his services."I owe you much," was her reply, "but I'm not going...
them.The carriage wouldn't carry that much.I walk: I prefer
to walk."

"But it is raining."

"Oh! very little, nothing I consider."

After a short pause, he said: 'Although I only came yesterday, I did
already equipped me well for Bath, you see, "(pointing to a new one
umbrella); "I wish you would take advantage of it, if you are determined to ...
to walk; although I think it would be wiser to give me a
chair."

She was very much obliged to him, but refused it all and repeated her
belief that the rain would come to naught at this point, adding:
“I'm just waiting for Mr. Elliot.He will be right here, I am
certainly."

She had barely spoken the words when Mr. Elliot came in.Captain
Wentworth remembered him perfectly.There was no difference between them
him and the man who had stood on the stairs near Lyme and admired Anne as…
she passed except in the air and gaze and manner of the privileged
relationship and friend.He came in eagerly, seemed to see and ...
think only of her, apologized for his stay, was sad to have been held
waiting for her, and eager to get her out without further loss of time
and before the rain increased; and at another moment they walked away
together, her arm under his, a soft and shy look, and a
"Good morning!" being all she had time for as she passed
away.As soon as they were out of sight, Captain Wentworth's ladies arrived
party started talking about them."Mr. Elliot doesn't hate his cousin, I guess?"

"Oh! No, that's plain enough".One can guess what will happen there.He's always with them; half live in the family, I believe.What a
very handsome man!"

"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who once dined with him in the Wallises, says ...
he is the most pleasant man she ever was in company with."

"She's beautiful, I think; Anne Elliot; very beautiful, when it comes down to it...
look at her.It's not the fashion to say that, but I must confess I admire it
her more than her sister."

"Oh! Me too."

"And I.No comparison.But the men are all wild behind Miss
Elliot.Anne is too delicate for them."

Anne would have been particularly obliged to her niece, if he had...
walked all the way to Camden Place by her side, without a
word.However, she had never found it so difficult to listen to him
nothing could exceed his concern and concern, and though his subjects...
were chiefly of those that were always interesting: praise,
warm, fair and discriminatory, from Lady Russell, and innuendo
very rational to Mrs. Clay.But just now she could only think of
Captain Wentworth.She couldn't understand his current feelings
whether he really suffered from disappointment or not; and
until that point was settled, she couldn't quite be herself.She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but unfortunately! Unfortunately! she must
confess to herself that she was not wise yet.Another circumstance that was very essential for her to know was how long he...
intended to be in Bath; he hadn't said anything about it, or she couldn't
remember it.He may be just passing through.But it was more
probably he would come and stay.In that case, as liable as
every body would meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all
you will probably see it somewhere.Would she remember him? How could it be?
are all?

She was already obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove
was to be married to Captain Benwick.It had cost her something to come across
Lady Russell's surprise; and now, if she ever were
cast into company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge of
the case could add another shadow of prejudice against him.The next morning Anne was out with her friend, and for the first time
hours, in a ceaseless and terrifying sort looking in vain for him; but at
finally, when she returned down Pulteney Street, she discerned him on the
right-hand paving at such a distance that it is within sight of the
most of the street.There were many other men around him, many
groups walked the same way, but there was no doubt about him.They
looked at Lady Russell instinctively; but not from a crazy idea of ​​hers
recognize him as soon as she did it herself.No, it shouldn't be
supposed lady russell would see him till they were almost
opposite.However, she looked at her now and then with fear; and
when the moment drew near to point him out, though not daringly
to look again (for her own face which she knew was unfit to be seen),
she was still fully aware that Lady Russell's eyes were being turned
right in the direction in front of him - of her being, in short, attentively -
observe him.She could understand the type of fascination
he must have Lady Russell's mind, the difficulty it must be...
that she had to withdraw her eyes, the amazement she must feel that
eight or nine years should have passed over him, and in strange lands...
and also on active duty, without robbing him of one personal grace!

Finally Lady Russell withdrew her head.Now how would she talk about it?
him?"

"You will wonder," she said, "what has held my eye for so long; but...
I arranged some curtains, which Lady Alicia and Mrs
Frankland told me about last night.They described the
parlor curtains from one of the houses on this side of the
way, and this part of the street, as the most beautiful and best hung
from anyone in Bath, but I couldn't remember the exact number, and I did
tried to find out what it could be; But I must confess I can't see it
curtains about this that correspond to their description."

Anne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and contempt, either at her
friend or herself.The part that provoked her the most was that in everything
this waste of foresight and prudence, she should have lost the right
moment to see if he saw them.A day or two passed without producing anything.The theater or the
rooms, where he probably would be, weren't fashionable enough for that
the Elliots, whose evening entertainment is exclusively in the elegant
stupidity of private parties, in which they got more and more
engaged; and Anne, tired of such a state of stagnation, sick of it
knowing nothing, and thinking herself stronger because her was strength
not tried, was quite impatient for concert night concert.It was a
concert on behalf of a person visited by Lady Dalrymple.From
of course they must attend.It was really expected to be a good one, and
Captain Wentworth loved music.If only she could have a few
minutes of conversation with him, she thought she should be
satisfied; and as for the power to address him, she felt completely over
courage when the opportunity arose.Elizabeth had turned away from him,
Lady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened by this
situation; she felt she owed him attention.She had once partially promised Mrs. Smith to spend the evening with her;
but in a short rushed phone call she apologized and postponed it, with
the more decided promise of a longer visit tomorrow.Mrs. Smith
gave a very good-humored assent."Certainly," she said; 'Just tell me all about it when you come.Who is your company? "

Anne named them all.Mrs. Smith did not answer; but when she left
she said, and with a half serious, half curvaceous expression, "Well, I...
sincerely wish you can answer concert; and don't forsake me tomorrow if:
you can come; because I'm starting to have a premonition that I might not have many
more visits from you."

Anne was startled and confused; but after standing for a moment
suspense, was obliged, and did not regret, to hasten.Chapter 20


Sir Walter, his two daughters and Mrs Clay were the first of them all
their evening party in the rooms; and as Lady Dalrymple should be
waited, they took their place at one of the fires in the Octagon
Room.But hardly were they so settled, when the door opened again, and...
Captain Wentworth came in alone.Anne was closest to him, and
she made a little more progress, she spoke immediately. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..He was preparing
only to bend and pass, but her soft "How are you?" brought him
out of a straight line to stand next to her and make inquiries
return, despite the formidable father and sister in the back
ground.Their presence in the background was a comfort to Anne; she knew
none of their looks, and felt equal to everything they believed
right to be done.While they were talking, a whisper between her father and Elizabeth
caught her ear.She couldn't make out, but she had to guess what the
subjects; and while Captain Wentworth makes a distant bow, she
understood that her father had judged so well to give it to him:
simple confirmation of knowledge, and she was just in time by a
she glances to see a little bow of Elizabeth herself.This,
though late, and reluctant and merciless, was still better than
nothing, and her mind improved.But after talking about the weather and Bath and the concert
their conversation started to slacken, and in the end so little was said that…
she expected him to go any minute, but he didn't; he seemed inside
in no hurry to leave her; and now with a renewed spirit, with a little
smile, a little glow, he said ...

"I've hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.I'm afraid you have to
suffered the shock, and all the more so for not being overwhelming
you at that moment."

She assured him she hadn't."It was a terrible hour," he said, "a terrible day!" and he succeeded
his hand over his eyes, as if the memory were still too painful,
but in the twinkling of an eye he added again, half smiling: 'The day has produced something wat
effects however; has had some consequences that should be considered as:
the opposite of terrifying.When you had the presence of mind to
suggest Benwick would be the best person to get a surgeon,
you could have little idea that after all he is one of the most
concerned about her recovery."

"I certainly couldn't have one.But it seems - I should hope it would
be a very happy game.There are good principles and on both sides
good mood."

"Yes," he said, not looking exactly ahead; "but there, I think, ends
the resemblance.I wish them happy with all my soul and am looking forward to it
any circumstance for it.They have no problem with it
struggling with home, no resistance, no whims, no delays.The
Musgroves act like themselves, very honorable and friendly,
only concerned with a real parental heart to promote their daughter's
comfort.All this is much, very much in favor of their happiness;
more than maybe ... '

He stopt.A sudden memory seemed to arise, and to give him...
a taste of that emotion that reddened and repaired Anne's cheeks?
her eyes on the ground.But after clearing his throat,
went on like this--

"I confess that I think there is an inequality, an inequality that is too great,
and on one point no less essential than the mind.I consider Louisa Musgrove
like a very lovable, gentle girl, and not lacking
understanding, but Benwick is something more.He's a smart man, and
reading man; and I confess that I think he is attached to it
surprised her.Had it been the result of gratitude, he would have
taught her to love because he believed she preferred him, it
would have been something else.But I have no reason to believe it is.On the contrary, it seems to be a completely spontaneous,
uneducated feeling on his side, and this surprises me.A man like him,
in his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken! fanny
Harville was a superior being, and his attachment to her was...
indeed attachment.A man does not recover from such devotion from the
heart for such a woman.He didn't belong; he does not."

Either from the consciousness that his friend had recovered,
or from another consciousness he went no further; and Anne who, despite
of the excited voice in which the last part was spoken, and in
despite all the different sounds of the room, the almost incessant slam
from the door, and the incessant buzz of people walking through it
discerned every word, was struck, delighted, confused, and...
start breathing really fast and feeling a hundred things in one
moment.It was impossible for her to go into such a subject; and yet,
after a pause, feel the need to speak, and not the
smallest wish for a total change, she deviated only so far as to say:

"You had a good time at Lyme, I guess?"

'About fourteen days.I couldn't resist until Louisa was okay...
pretty sure.I was too deeply concerned about the harm
be in peace soon.It had been my job, just mine.She wouldn't
were stubborn if I hadn't been weak.The land around Lyme is
very good.I walked and drove a lot; and the more I saw, the more
I found more to admire."

'I would really like to see Lyme again,' said Anne.'Indeed! I shouldn't have assumed you could have found anything
in Lyme to inspire such a feeling.The horror and sorrow that you were
involved in, the state of mind, the wear of spirits! I should have
thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been a strong disgust."

"The last hours were certainly very painful," Anne replied; "but when
pain is over, the memory of it often becomes a pleasure.one does
don't like a place, all the less because you have suffered in it, unless it has been there
all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was by no means the case with
Lyme.We were only in fear and sorrow for the past two hours,
and it used to be a lot of fun.That much
novelty and beauty! I have traveled so little, that every new place
would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty in Lyme; and in
short "(with a faint blush on some memories)," all mine
impressions of the place are very pleasant?."

When she stopped, the entrance door opened again, and the party itself ...
appeared who they were waiting for.Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,
was the gratifying sound; and with all the eagerness that is compatible with it
fearful elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet
her.Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, accompanied by Mr Elliot and
Colonel Wallis, who happened to have arrived almost at the same time,
entered the room.The others joined them, and it was a group in
which Anne herself necessarily belonged to.She was divided
from Captain Wentworth.Their interesting, almost too interesting
the conversation had to be interrupted for a while, but the penance was minor
compared to the happiness it brought! She had learned, in
the last ten minutes, more of his feelings for Louisa, more of everything
his feelings than she dared to imagine; and she surrendered herself to the
demands of the party, to the necessary pleasantries of the moment, with
exquisite, albeit agitated sensations.She was in good spirits with
all.She had been given ideas that tended her to be courteous and
kind to everyone, and to everyone, because she is less happy than herself.The delightful emotions were a little subdued when they stepped back?
of the group, to be joined by Captain Wentworth again, she saw that
he was gone.She was just in time to see him play in the Concert
Room.He was gone; he was gone, she felt a moment of regret.But "they should meet again.He would look for her, he would find her
before the night was over, and it may have been right now
good to be apart.She needed a little break before
reminder."

When Lady Russell showed up shortly after, it was all partying
gathered, and all that was left was to gather and move on
in the Concert Room; and of all consequences are in their power,
draw so many eyes, generate so many whispers and disturb so many people
as they could.Very, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot when they came in.Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking over the broad back
Viscountess Dalrymple's widow before her, had nothing to be desired
for which she seemed out of reach; and Anne - but it could be a ...
insult to the nature of Anne's happiness, to compare:
it and her sister's; the origin of the one, all selfish vanity, of the other
all generous attachment.Anne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliance of the room.Her
happiness was from within.Her eyes were clear and her cheeks glowed;
but she didn't know about it.She only thought about the last half
hours, and as they walked to their seats, her mind took a hasty distance
across.His choice of subjects, his expressions and more his own
manner and appearance, had been as she could see in only one light.To be
opinion about the inferiority of Louisa Musgrove, an opinion he had
seemed concerned to care, his wonder at Captain Benwick, his feelings
as to a first, strong attachment; started sentences he couldn't
finish, his half averted eyes and more than half expressive look,
all, all declared that at least he had a heart that returned to her; Which
anger, resentment, avoidance, were gone; and they were
passed, not only through friendship and respect, but through tenderness
from the past.Yes, some of the tenderness of the past.she could
don't think of the change as being less;.He must love her.These were thoughts, with the accompanying visions, that occupy and
rushed her too much to leave her any sense of perception; and they
walked across the room without catching a glimpse of him, without even
try to distinguish him.When their places was set, and they ...
were all well arranged, she looked around to see if it would happen
to be in the same part of the room, but he wasn't; her eye could not
reach him; and because the concert is just opening, she has to give permission for one
time to be happy in a humble way.The party was divided and disposed of in two contiguous benches: Anne
was one of the most distinguished people, and Mr. Elliot had maneuvered so well,
with the help of his friend Colonel Wallis, to take a seat at...
her.Miss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins ​​and the main object
of Colonel Wallis's bravery, was very pleased.Anne's mind was in a very favorable state for the entertainment of the...
evening; it was just enough: she had feelings for the
tender, spirits for gays, attention to science and patience
for the exhausting; and at least never loved a concert so much
during the first act.Towards the end of it, in the break
as a follow-up to an Italian song, she explained the words of the song to Mr
Elliot.They had a concert bill between them.“This,” she said, “is almost the meaning, or rather the meaning of the
words, because the meaning of an Italian love song should certainly not be
spoken of, but it is as good as the meaning I can give; because I don't
pretend you understand the language.I am a very poor Italian scholar."

"Yes, yes, I see you are.I see you don't know anything about it.YOU
only have sufficient knowledge of the language to translate it on sight
inverted, transposed, truncated Italian lines, in clear,
understandable, elegant English.You don't have to say more about it
your ignorance.Here is full proof."

"I won't resist such kind courtesy, but I'd be sorry if I...
examined by a true professional."

"I haven't had the pleasure of visiting Camden Place for so long,"
he replied, "not knowing anything about Miss Anne Elliot; and I know...
consider her someone too humble for the world in general to be
aware of half of her achievements, and reached too high for
modesty to be natural with every other woman."

For shame! For shame! This is too much flattery.I forget what we are
to have the next, 'turn to the bill."Maybe," said Mr. Elliot, speaking softly, "I've had it longer
familiarity with your character than you are aware."

"Indeed! How so? You can't be familiar with it until I...
came to Bath, except as you may have heard me speak before in my
own family."

"I knew you long before you came to Bath".I heard you
described by those who knew you intimately.I have known
with your character for many years.Your person, your character,
performance, manner; they were all there for me."

Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to arouse.No
one can resist the charm of such a mystery.To be described
long ago for a recent acquaintance, by nameless people, is irresistible;
and Anne was all curiosity.She wondered and questioned him eagerly;
but in vain.He loved being asked about it, but he wouldn't tell.'No, no, maybe once, but not now.He would say no
names now; but that, he could assure her, had been the fact.He had
received such a description from Miss Anne Elliot many years ago as had
inspired him with the highest idea of ​​her merit, and aroused it
warmest curiosity to get to know her."

Anne could not think of anyone who had so likely spoken with partiality
her many years ago as Mr Wentworth of Monkford, Captain Wentworth's
brother.He may have been in the company of Mr. Elliot, but she wasn't...
courage to ask the question."Anne Elliot's name," he said, "has long had an interesting sound...
to me.For a long time it has had a charm beyond my imagination; and, if i
dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name would never change."

Those were his words, she thought; but hardly she had their ...
sound, her attention was drawn to other sounds directly behind it
hair, which made everything else trivial.Her father and Lady
Dalrymple was speaking."A handsome man," said Sir Walter, "a very handsome man ...."

"A very fine young man indeed!" said Lady Dalrymple."More air than
see you often in Bath.Irish, I dare say."

'No, I only know his name.A bending knowledge.Wentworth; Captain
Wentworth of the Navy.His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire,
the Croft, who hires Kellynch."

Before Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne's eyes had the...
right direction, and Captain Wentworth distinguished standing between a
cluster men at a short distance.While her eyes fell on him, his
seemed to have withdrawn from her.It had that look.It seemed so
if she had been a moment late; and as long as she dared to observe,
he no longer looked: but the performance started again, and they ...
was forced to return her attention to the orchestra and her gaze
straightforward.When she could take another look, he had run away.He couldn't
have come closer to her if he wanted to; she was so surrounded and locked up:
but she would rather have caught his attention.Mr. Elliot's speech also upset her.She didn't have any more
tendency to talk to him.She wished he wasn't so close to her.The first act was done.Now she hoped for a favorable change; and,
after a period of saying nothing among the party, some did
decide to look for tea.Anne was one of the few who didn't
choose to move.She stayed in her chair, and so did Lady Russell; but
she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr. Elliot; and she didn't mean
whatever she would feel for Lady Russell, to recoil from
talk to Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the chance.She was convinced by Lady Russell's face that she had seen him....However, he did not come.Anne sometimes had the impression that she was on a…
away, but he never came.The anxious interval disappeared
unproductive.The others came back, the room filled again, benches
were reclaimed and taken back, and another hour of fun or from
fine had to be seated, another hour of music was to give pleasure or
the gapes, since the real or tainted taste prevailed for it.For Anne, it
mainly bore the prospect of an hour of excitement.She couldn't stop
that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth again, without
the exchange of a friendly aura.In relocating, there were now many changes, the result of
which was good for her.Colonel Wallis refused to sit
again, and Mr. Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a
way not to be denied, to sit between them; and by another
relocations, and a bit of her own scheming, Anne was allowed to place
herself much closer to the end of the couch than she had been before, much
more within reach of a passerby.She couldn't do this without it
to compare herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles; but
yet she did, and not with much happier effect; though by what?
seemed prosperity in the form of an early abdication in her next
neighbors, she found herself at the very end of the couch in front of the
concert closed.That was her situation, with an empty space at hand, when Captain
Wentworth was in sight again.She didn't see him far away.he saw her
to; yet he looked serious and seemed indecisive, and only by very slowly…
degrees finally got close enough to talk to her.She felt that
there must be something going on.The change was indisputable.The
difference between his current stance and what it had been in the Octagon
Room was strikingly great.Why was it? She thought of her father
Lady Russell.Would there have been any unpleasant looks? He started
by speaking earnestly about the concert, more like the captain Wentworth of
upper cross; was disappointed, expected singing; and in
in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.Anne
answered, and spoke so well in defense of the execution, and yet in
consider his feelings so pleasant, that his countenance
improved, and he replied again with almost a smile.They spoke for a
a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down in the direction of the
sofa, as if he saw on it a place worth occupying; when at that
A moment when she touched her shoulder forced Anne to turn.It came
from Mr Elliot.He begged her forgiveness, but she must be applied to, in order ...
explain Italian again.Miss Carteret was very curious about a
general idea of ​​what would be sung next.Anne couldn't refuse; but
never had she sacrificed herself to politeness with a more suffering spirit.A few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed; and
then her own mistress again, when she was able to turn and look as she had done
before that she was approached by Captain Wentworth, in a reserved one
yet a hasty goodbye.'He must wish her good night; that was him
to go; he should go home as soon as possible."

"Isn't this song worth staying for?" said Anne, suddenly struck by a…
idea that made her even more anxious to be encouraging."No!" he replied impressively, "There is nothing worth holding out for;"
and he immediately disappeared.Jealousy from Mr. Elliot! It was the only comprehensible motive.Captain
Wentworth jealous of her affection! Could she have believed it for a week?
ago; three hours ago! For a moment the satisfaction was exquisite.But unfortunately! there were very different thoughts to succeed.How was that?
jealousy to calm down? How could the truth reach him? How, all in all
the peculiar drawbacks of their respective situations, could he?
ever found out about her real feelings? It was a pain to tell Mr. thinking
Elliot's Attentions.Their harm was incalculable.Chapter 21


The next morning Anne fondly remembered her promise to go there
Mrs Smith, which means she needs to move her in at the time of home
Mr. Elliot would probably call; because to avoid Mr. Elliot was...
almost a first object.She felt a lot of good will towards him.In spite of the
mischief over his attentions, she may have owed him gratitude and esteem
compassion.She couldn't help but think a lot about the extraordinary
circumstances attending their knowledge, of the right he
seemed to be interested in her, by everything in the situation, by his own zijn
feelings, because of his early hunch.It was really bad
out of the ordinary; flattering but painful.There was a lot to regret.How
she would have felt if there hadn't been Captain Wentworth in the case,
was not worth the investigation; for there was a Captain Wentworth; and be the
conclusion of the current tension, good or bad, would be her affection
are forever.Their union, she thought, could no longer divide her
from other men, then their final divorce.More beautiful musings of highly worked love and eternal steadfastness, could
never been through the streets of Bath then Anne was working out
with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings.It was almost enough
spread purification and perfume all the way.She was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend looked like this
morning particularly obliged for her to come, hardly seemed to have?
expected her, although it had been an appointment.A record of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne's
memories of the concert were quite fortunate enough to animate her
characteristics and make her happy to talk about it.Anything she could tell
she liked to tell, but it was all small for someone who had been
there, and unsatisfactory for such an investigator as Mrs Smith, who had
already heard, by the shortcut of a laundress and a waiter,
rather more of the overall success and result of the evening than Anne
could tell, and which now in vain to explain various details of the
company.Everyone of any significance or renown in Bath was well
know by name to Mrs. Smith.“The little Durands were there, I conclude,” she said, “with their ...
mouths open to receive the music, like unfertilized sparrows ready for it
fed.They never miss a concert."

"Yeah, I didn't see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were inside
the room."

“The Ibbotsons, were they there? And the two new beauties, with the ...
tall Irish officer, talked about for one of them."

"I do not know.I don't think they were."

"Old Lady Mary Maclean? I don't have to ask about her....She never misses me
know; and you must have seen her.She must have been with you
circle; because when you went with Lady Dalrymple, you sat in the chairs of...
grandeur, of course around the orchestra."

"No, that was what I was afraid of.It would have been very unpleasant for me
in every sense.But luckily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be
further away; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is, to hear;
I shouldn't say to see as apparently I've seen very little."

"Oh! You've seen enough for your own entertainment".I can understand.Over there
is a kind of home pleasure that is known even in a crowd, and this
you had.You were a big party in yourself, and you didn't want anything
out there."

"But I should have looked around more," Anne said, conscious as ...
she said that in fact there was no lack of looking around, that
the object had only been flawed."No, no; you could have done a better job".You don't have to tell me you have one
pleasant evening.I see it in your eyes.I see perfectly how the hours
passed on: that you always had something pleasant to listen to.In the
intervals of the concert was the talk."

Anne half smiled and said, "Do you see that in my eyes?"

"Yes I do.Your face lets me know perfectly that you are participating
last night's company with the person you are most comfortable with
the world, the person that interests you more than
the rest of the world together."

A blush over Anne's cheeks.She couldn't say anything."And if that's the case," continued Mrs. Smith, after a short pause, "I ...
hope you believe i know how i appreciate your kindness to come to
me this morning.It's really good of you to join us
me, when you must have so many more pleasant demands of your time."

Anne heard nothing about this.She was still amazed and
confusion generated by her friend's penetration, unable to imagine how
any message from Captain Wentworth could have reached her.One after the other
short silence--

'Pray,' said Mrs. Smith, 'is Mr. Elliot aware of your acquaintance
me? Does he know I'm in Bath? "

"Mr. Elliot!" Anne repeated, looking up in surprise.A moment
reflection showed her the mistake she had made.She caught it
immediately; and regain her courage with the sense of security,
added soon, more calmly, "Do you know Mr. Elliot?"

"I've gotten to know him a lot," replied Mrs. Smith,
seriously, "but it seems worn out now.It's been a great time since we met."

"I was not aware of this at all".You never mentioned it before.Had I
If I had known, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you."

"To confess the truth," said Mrs. Smith, in her usual attitude of...
cheerfulness, "that's exactly the pleasure I want you to have.I want
you to talk about me with Mr. Elliot.I want your interest in him.He
can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,
my dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object for yourself, of course it is
done."

"I should be very happy; I hope you don't question my willingness to ...
be of even the slightest use to you, "replied Anne;" but I guess ...
you consider me a higher claim to Mr Elliot, a greater one
right to influence him than is actually the case.I'm sure you have
somehow, took up such an idea.You should only consider me as
Mr. Elliot's relationship.If there is something in that light that you
suppose his cousin would ask him honestly, I beg you not to
hesitate to hire me."

Mrs. Smith gave her a penetrating look, then said with a smile:

'I've been a bit premature, I understand; excuse me.I
should have waited for official information.But now my dear miss
Elliot, like an old friend, give me a hint when I may speak.Next week? Just to be sure, I can think everything next week
arranged, and build my own selfish plans on Mr. Elliot's happiness."

"No," replied Anne, "neither next week, nor next, nor next.I assure you
that nothing of the kind that you think about will be arranged every week.I'm not getting married to Mr. Elliot.I would like to know why you
imagine i am? "

Mrs Smith looked at her again, looked serious, smiled, shook her
head, and exclaimed:

"Well, how I wish I understood you! How I wish I knew what you were"
were at! I have a great idea you're not designing to be cruel, when?
the right time occurs.Until it comes, you know, we women never
mean to have someone.It is, of course, one thing among us that every man
is refused until he offers.But why should you be cruel? Let me plead
for my current boyfriend I can't name him but for my former boyfriend.Where can you look for a more suitable match? Where would you get a
more gentlemanlike, pleasant man? Let me recommend Mr Elliot.I am
surely you will hear nothing but good from him from Colonel Wallis; and who can
know him better than Colonel Wallis?"

"My dear Mrs. Smith, Mr. Elliot's wife has not been much more than half dead."
a year.He shouldn't pay his addresses to anyone
a."

"Oh! If these are your only objections," cried Mrs. Smith, startled, "Mr.
Elliot is safe and I will not worry about him anymore.To do
don't forget me when you're married that's all.Let him know I am
a friend of yours, and then he won't worry much about the trouble
required, which is very natural for him now, with so many things
and his own pursuits, to avoid and get rid of them as much as possible; whole
of course, maybe.Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.From
he obviously cannot be aware of the importance to me.Well my dear miss
Elliot I hope and trust you will be very happy gelukkig.Mr Elliot has sense
to understand the value of such a woman.Your peace will not be there
shipwrecked as mine has been.You are safe in all worldly affairs, and
safe in his character.He will not be led astray; he won't be
deceived by others to his downfall."

"No," said Anne, "I can believe all that about my cousin ....He
seems to have a calm, determined mood, not at all prone to dangerous
impressions.I regard him with great respect.I have no reason
of something that has fallen within my perception, to do it differently.But I have not known him long; and he's not a man, I guess, to be
intimately known soon.Won't this way of speaking be his, ma'am?
Smith, are you sure he's not for me? This should be quiet
enough.And, on my word, he's nothing to me.Would he ever
introduce me (which I have very little reason to believe has one
thought to do), I will not accept him.I assure you I won't.I assure you Mr. Elliot did not have the share you were
suppose in whatever pleasure last night's concert could afford:
not Mr Elliot; it's not Mr. Elliot who ... "

She stopped and regretted with a deep flush that she had suggested so much;
but less would hardly have been enough.Mrs. Smith would hardly
so quickly believed in Mr. Elliot's failure, but from the perception
that there is someone else.As it was, she immediately submitted,
and with the appearance of seeing nothing further; and Anne, eager to
escape further message, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have done
thought she was going to marry Mr. Elliot; where they the
idea, or who she could have heard from."Tell me how it first popped into your head."

"It first popped into my head," replied Mrs. Smith, "when I found out how much...
you were together and felt that this was the most likely in the...
world that everyone who belongs to both of you wishes; and you
may depend on all of your acquaintances having you
the same way.But I never heard about it until two days ago."

"And has it really been discussed?"

"Did you see the woman who opened the door for you when you called?
yesterday?"

"No.Wasn't it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid? I was not observing anyone
mostly."

"It was my friend Mrs. Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who by the way is a wonderful…
curiosity to see you, and was delighted to let you in the way.She didn't get out of Marlborough Buildings until Sunday; and it was her
who told me you'd marry Mr. Elliot?.She got it from Mrs
Wallis himself, which didn't seem like a bad authority.She sat with
me on Monday night, and gave me all the history." "The whole
history, "Anne repeated, laughing."She couldn't last long
history, I think, of such a small article with groundless news."

Mrs Smith didn't say anything."But," continued Anne, "though there is no truth in my ...
with this claim to mr elliot, i would be extremely happy to be there
use it to you in a way that I could.Shall I call him your being?
in Bath? Shall I take a message? "

"No, thank you: no, certainly not.In the warmth of the moment, and
under the wrong impression I might have tried to ...
interest you in certain circumstances; but not now.No, thank you, I.
have nothing to bother you with."

"I think you said you've known Mr. Elliot for many years?"

"I did."

"Not until he got married, I suppose?"

"Yes, he wasn't married when I first met him"."

'And - did you know much?'

"Intimate."

'Indeed! Then tell me what he was at that time in his life.I have a
great curiosity to know what Mr. Elliot was as a very young man.Was he
not at all as it looks now? "

"I haven't seen Mr. Elliot in the last three years," was Mrs. Smith's reply,
so serious that it was impossible to elaborate on the subject;
and Anne felt that she had only grown curiosity.They were both silent: Mrs. Smith was very thoughtful.Finally--

"Excuse me, my dear Miss Elliot," she cried, naturally
show cordiality, “Please excuse me for the short answers I have
I gave you, but I was not sure what to do.I have
have doubted and thought about what I should tell you.Over there
were there many things to consider?.People hate to be
unofficially, to give bad impressions, to harm.Even the
the smooth surface of the family association seems worth preserving, although it is possible
nothing sustainable.However, I have determined; I think it is me
Turn right; I think you should meet Mr Elliot's real
character.While I am fully convinced that you do not have the
the slightest intention to accept him, there is no telling what may happen
to happen.You may be affected differently at one time or another from:
him.Hence, hear the truth now while being unbiased.mr
Elliot is a man without heart or conscience; a designing, wary,
cold-blooded creature, thinking only of itself; who for his own
interest or convenience, would be guilty of cruelty or treason,
that could be committed without compromising its general character.He
has no feeling for others.The ones he has been the main cause of
leading to ruin, he can neglect and leave without the smallest
remorse.He is totally beyond the reach of any sense of it
justice or compassion.Oh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!"

Anne's astonished attitude and exclamation of surprise made her pause for a moment, and
in a calmer way, she added,

"My expressions scare you.You have to take into account an injured, angry
woman.But I'll try to command myself.I will not abuse him.I
will only tell you what I found him.Facts will speak.He was
the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him, and
liked him as much as himself.Intimacy had been formed before
our marriage.I thought they were the most intimate of friends; and I became too
extremely pleased with Mr. Elliot, and had the highest opinion
from him.When you're nineteen, you know, you don't think very seriously; but
Mr Elliot seemed to me as good as others, and much more
pleasant than most, and we were almost always together.We
were mainly in the city and lived in very good style.He was then the
inferior in circumstances; he was the poor one then; he had rooms in
the temple, and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance support
of a gentleman.He always had a house with us when he chose it; he
was always welcome; he was like a brother.My poor Charles, he had ...
the best, most generous spirit in the world would have divided his
last cent with him; and I know his purse was open to him; I
knows he often helped him."

"This must have been about the same period in Mr. Elliot's life," said
Anne, 'which has always aroused my special curiosity.I need to have
was about the same time he became known to my father and sister.I never knew him myself; I've only heard of him; but there was something
in his behavior then, with regard to my father and sister, and
then in the circumstances of his marriage, which I never could nooit
completely reconcilable with the present time.It seemed to announce something else
kind of man."

"I know it all, I know it all," cried Mrs Smith."He was
introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was introduced to
him, but I heard him talk about them forever.I know he was invited and
encouraged, and I know he didn't choose to go.I can satisfy you
perhaps on points that you would hardly expect; and as for his
marriage, I knew all about it then.I was familiar with all the big for
and against; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans;
and although I did not know his wife before, her inferior situation
in society indeed made that impossible, but I knew her all
live after that, or at least into the last two years of her
life, and can answer any question you want."

'No,' said Anne, 'I have no specific research on her.I
have always understood that they were not a happy couple.But I would like to
to know why he should despise my father's at that time in his life
knowledge as he did.My father was certainly inclined to very
kind and correct notice from him.Why did Mr. Elliot withdraw? '

“Mr. Elliot,” Mrs. Smith replied, “had one at that time in his life
goal ahead: to make his fortune, and through a rather faster process
than the law.He was determined to make it through marriage.He was
determined not to spoil it in any case by a careless marriage; and I
know it was his faith (rightly or wrong, of course I can't)
decide), that your father and sister, in their pleasantries and
invitations, were designing a match between the heir and the youngsters
lady, and it was impossible that such a match could have answered his
ideas about wealth and independence.That was his motive for drawing
back, I can assure you.He told me the whole story.He had none
concealment with me.It was strange that I just left you
me in Bath, my first and foremost knowledge about getting married should be:
your cousin; and that through him I would hear constantly
your father and sister.He described a Mrs. Elliot, and I thought...
very loving of the other."

'Maybe,' Anne cried, suddenly struck by an idea, 'you mentioned
me to Mr. Elliot? "

"Just to be sure, I did that; very often.I always bragged about my own Anne Elliot,
and vouch that you are a very different being than...'

She checked herself just in time.'This explains something Mr. Elliot said last night,' he cried
Anne."This explains it".I found out he was used to hearing from me.I
couldn't understand how.What wild fantasies are one where dear?
itself is concerned! How sure you are wrong! But excuse me; I
interrupted you.Then Mr. Elliot got married completely for money?
The circumstances, probably, that first opened your eyes to him
character."

Mrs. Smith hesitated for a moment."Oh! Those things happen too often.If one lives in the world, it is also true that a man or a woman marries for money
customary to hit one as it should.I was very young and associated
alone with the young, and we were a thoughtless, gay set, without any without
strict rules of conduct.We lived for pleasure.I think differently
now; time and sickness and sorrow have changed my mind; but at
that period which I must possess, I saw nothing objectionable in what Mr Elliot
was doing.'Doing the best for yourself' continued as a duty."

"But wasn't she a very low woman?"

"Yes; which I objected, but he paid no heed.Money, money, laundry
everything he wanted.Her father was grazier, her grandfather had been
a butcher, but none of that was anything.She was a fine woman, had a
decent education, was brought up by some cousins, thrown by chance
in the company of Mr. Elliot and fell in love with him; and not one
trouble or any qualms was there on his side, regarding her
birth.All his caution was spent in getting the actual amount
of her fortune, before he commits.Depend on it, whatever
regard Mr Elliot may have now, as a youngster, for his own situation in life
man he didn't have the slightest value for it.His chance for the Kellynch
estate was a thing, but all the family honor was cheap to him
like dirt.I have often heard him declare that if there were baronets ...
salable, everyone should have his for fifty pounds, weapons and motto,
name and color scheme included; but I won't pretend to repeat half that I
always heard him say on that subject.It wouldn't be fair; and yet
you should have proof, because what is all this but a statement, and you...
will have proof."

'Indeed, my dear Mrs. Smith, I don't want one,' cried Anne."You have
claimed nothing contrary to what appeared to be Mr Elliot
years ago.This is all confirmation of what we used to do
hear and believe.I'm more curious to know why he should be like this
now different."

"But for my satisfaction, if you have the kindness to call ...
Maria; stay: I'm sure you'll have the even greater goodness of
go to my bedroom myself and bring me the small inlaid box
which you will find on the top shelf of the cupboard."

Anne, seeing that her friend was serious about it, did what she was
desirable.The box was brought and set in front of her, and Mrs. Smith,
sighing about it as she opened it said:

"This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband; a small
just part of what I had to watch when I lost it.the letter i.
I was looking for one that Mr. Elliot had written to him before our marriage,
and accidentally saved; why one can hardly imagine.But he was
careless and unmethodic, like other men, about those things; and when
I came to see his papers, I found it even more with others
trivial, from different people scattered here and there, while many
letters and memoranda of real importance had been destroyed.here it
is; I wouldn't burn it, because even then I was very little satisfied
with Mr. Elliot, I was determined to review every document from past...
intimacy.I now have another motive to be happy that I can produce
it."

This was the letter addressed to "Charles Smith, Esq.Tunbridge Wells, "
and dated from London, as early as July 1803:

"Dear Smith, I received yours".Your kindness almost dominates
me.I wish nature had made hearts like yours more often, but I
have lived in the world twenty-three years, and have seen none
it.Right now, believe me, I don't need your services
money again.Give me joy: I am rid of Sir Walter and Miss.They
went back to Kellynch, almost made me swear to visit them
summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor, to tell
me how to bring it to the hammer with the best advantage?.the baron,
nevertheless, it is not unlikely that he will marry again; he's pretty silly enough.But if he does, they'll leave me alone, which can be a decent one
equivalent for the reversal.He's worse than last year."I wish I had a different name than Elliot.I am sick of it.The name of
Walter, I can drop, thank goodness! and I wish you would never insult me ​​me
with my second W..again, that is, for the rest of my life, to be alone
yours really, - Wm.Elliot."

Such a letter cannot be read without glowing Anne; and Mrs.
Smith, looking at the high color in her face, said:

'I know the language is very disrespectful.Though I forgot
the exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning.But it shows you the man.Mark his professions for my poor husband.Could anything be stronger? "

Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of ...
finding such words applied to her father.She had to remember
that seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honor, that ...
no one should be judged or known by such testimonies, that no one
private correspondence could grab the attention of others before she could
recover enough composure to return the letter she had been
meditating about, and say--

"Thank you.This is undoubtedly full proof; proof of everything you do
said:.But why meet us now?"

"I can explain this too," Mrs. Smith shouted, smiling."Can you really?"

"Yes.I showed you Mr. Elliot as he was ten years ago, and I.
will show him as he is now.I cannot provide written proof again, however
I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can to what he is
want now, and what he is doing now.He's not a hypocrite now.He
really want to marry you.His current focus on your family is:
very sincere: very from the heart.I will give you my authority: to be
friend Colonel Wallis."

'Colonel Wallis! Do you know him? '

"No.It doesn't come to me in such a direct line; it
takes a few turns, but nothing important.The flow is so good
as in the beginning; the little garbage it collects in the turns is easy
moved.Mr Elliot talks unconditionally with Colonel Wallis from his...
views on you who said Colonel Wallis, I imagine he is one in himself
sensible, careful, distinctive kind of character; but Colonel Wallis has ...
a very beautiful foolish woman, to whom he tells things he had better beter
no, and he repeats it all for her.She in the overflowing minds of
her recovery, repeating it all to her nurse; and the nurse who knows me
getting to know you brings it very naturally to me.On Monday
In the evening my good friend Mrs. Rooke showed me so much in the secrets of . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

"My dear Mrs. Smith, your authority is inadequate".This is not enough.mr
Elliot who has any opinion about me will not be the reason for the
efforts he made for reconciliation with my father.That was all
before I came to Bath.I found them on the most friendly of terms
when i arrived."

"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--"

"Indeed, Ms. Smith, we should not expect to get any real information in such"
a line.Facts or opinions that pass through the hands of so
many who are understood by foolishness in the one and by ignorance in the other can
there is hardly much truth left about it."

Listen to me.Soon you will be able to judge the general
credit, by listening to some specifics you can yourself
immediately contradict or confirm.Nobody assumes you were his
first prompt.He had indeed seen you before he came to Bath, and...
admired you, but without knowing it was you.That's what my historian says,
at least.Is this true? Did he see you last summer or fall
'somewhere in the west', to use her own words, without knowing it
to be you?"

'He certainly did.So far it's very true.With Lyme.I happened to be
at Lyme."

"Well," continued Mrs. Smith triumphantly, "give credit to my friend ...
because of the determination of the first point raised.He saw you then
at Lyme, and liked you so much it was an extraordinary pleasure to meet you
with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot, and from then on
moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in his visits there.But
there was another, and an earlier one, which I will now explain.If there
is everything in my story that you know is wrong or
unlikely, stop me.My account states that your sister's friend, the
the lady who is staying with you now, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath
with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter already in September (in short when
they came first themselves), and have remained there ever since;
that she's a smart, insinuating, pretty woman, poor and plausible,
and all in all so in situation and manner, to give a general idea,
under the knowledge of Sir Walter, about her intention to be Lady Elliot, and
as a general surprise that Miss Elliot would apparently be blind to...
the danger."

Here Mrs. Smith paused; but Anne had not a word to say, and she...
continued--

"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,
long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye on ...
your father enough to know about it, although he didn't come to visit then
at Camden Place; but his respect for Mr. Elliot gave him interest in
look at everything that happened there, and when Mr. Elliot came to Bath...
for a day or two, as he happened to do just before Christmas,
Colonel Wallis introduced him to the appearance of things, and ...
the reports are starting to take over.Now you have to understand, that time
had brought about a very material change in Mr. Elliot's view of the
value of a baronetcy.On all points of blood and bandage he is a
completely changed man.Because he had had as much money as he could for a long time
to spend, wishing nothing on the side of greed or indulgence, he has hij
gradually learned to plot his happiness in the consequence that he is
heir of.I thought it came up before our acquaintance ended, but it's...
is now a confirmed feeling.He cannot bear the idea that he is not the lord
Willem.You may therefore guess that the news he heard from his
friend couldn't be very pleasant, and you can guess what it produced;
the decision to return to Bath as soon as possible, and
settle here for a while, with a view to renewing its former
acquaintance, and regaining such a position in the family as might give
him the means of assessing the degree of his danger, and of
bypass the lady if he found the material.This was agreed
between the two friends as all that needs to be done; and Colonel
Wallis had to assist in every way possible.He should be
proposed, and Mrs. Wallis would be introduced, and everyone would ...
be introduced.Mr. Elliot returned accordingly; and on request
forgiven, as you know, and reintroduced into the family; and there it is
was his constant object, and his only object (added until your arrival
another motive), to look at Sir Walter and Mrs. Clay.He omitted no
opportunity to be with them, threw himself in the way, cried
all hours; but I don't need to be specific on this topic.You can
imagine what a crafty man would do; and with this guide maybe,
remember what you saw him do."

"Yes," said Anne, "you are not telling me anything that is not in accordance with what ...
I knew it, or could imagine it.There is always something offensive in it
the details of cunning.The maneuvers of selfishness and duplicity
must be revolting at some point, but I haven't heard anything that really surprises
me.I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr
Elliot, who would have a hard time believing it; but I never have
been satisfied.I've always wanted a different motive for his behavior
then appeared.I would like to know his current opinion on the
likelihood of the event he feared; whether he is considering
the danger of diminishing or not."

"Less, I understand," replied Mrs Smith.'He thinks Mrs. Clay
afraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and doesn't dare...
carry on as she would in his absence.But since he must be absent
someday i don't see how he can ever be safe veilig
it retains its current influence.Mrs. Wallis has a funny idea, like
nurse tells me it should be put in the matrimonial articles when...
you and Mr. Elliot, that your father should not marry Mrs. Clay.A
plan worthy of Ms. Wallis's understanding, in every way; but my
sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it."Well, to be sure,
ma'am, ”she said,“ it wouldn't stop him from marrying someone else.'
And indeed, in order to possess the truth, I don't think a nurse is, in her heart, one
very strenuous opponent making a second match from Sir Walter.She must
may favor marriage, you know; and (since myself)
will penetrate) who can say she may not have flying visions of
attending the next Lady Elliot, on the recommendation of Mrs Wallis?"

"I'm very happy to know all this," Anne said after a while
thoughtfulness.“It will be more painful for me in some ways
in the company of him, but I'll know better what to do.My line of
behavior will be more direct.Mr. Elliot is clearly an insincere,
artificial, worldly man, who never had a better principle
then lead him selfishness."

But Mr Elliot wasn't ready yet.Mrs. Smith had been taken away
her first direction, and Anne had forgotten it, for her own sake
family worries, how many had originally been suggested to him; but
her attention was now drawn to the explanation of those first hints,
and she listened to a recital that, if not perfectly justified
Mrs. Smith's unconditional bitterness, proved that he was very ...
numb in his behavior towards her; very flawed both in righteousness
and compassion.She discovered that (the intimacy between them remains untouched by Mr
Elliot's marriage), they had always been together as before, and Mr.
Elliot had paid his friend expenses in excess of his fortune.Mrs
Smith did not want to blame himself and was very tender
throwing one at her husband; but Anne could collect that from their income
had never been the same as their way of life, and that from the beginning
there had been a lot of general and corporate extravagance.From
When his wife told him she could see that Mr. Smith was male
of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong
understanding, much more lovable than his friend, and very different from him,
guided by him, and probably despised by him.Mr. Elliot, raised by his
marriage with great wealth, and desirous of every satisfaction of
pleasure and vanity that could be commanded without involving oneself,
(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a wise man), and
starting to get rich, just as his friend should have noticed
being poor, didn't seem to have worried about that friend's at all
probable finances, but, on the contrary, had prompted and
encouraging spending that could only end up in ruins; and the Smiths
was ruined accordingly.The husband had died just in time to full knowledge of it
it.They had known enough shame before the
friendship of their friends, and to prove that Mr. Elliot's was better?
not be tested; but it was not until his death that the miserable condition of
his affairs were fully known.With confidence in the esteem of Mr. Elliot,
more honorable to his feelings than to his judgment, Mr. Smith had ...
appointed him executor of his will; but Mr. Elliot wouldn't act,
and the difficulties and sorrows that this refusal had caused her,
in addition to the inevitable suffering of her situation
which could not be told without fear of the mind, or listened to
without corresponding indignation.Anne was given the opportunity to see some letters from him, answers to urgent
requests from Mrs. Smith, who all breathed the same stern
resolution not to face a fruitless problem, and, under a cold,
politeness, the same harsh indifference to all the evil it does
could bring her.It was a horrible picture of ingratitude and ...
inhumanity; and at times Anne felt that there was no blatant overt crime
could have been worse.She had a lot to listen to; all the
details of sad scenes from the past, all the details of sorrow on
suffering, only hinted at in previous conversations, were:
now stopped with a natural indulgence.Anne could do it perfectly
to understand the fine relief, and was only more inclined to it
marvel at the calmness of her boyfriend's usual frame of mind.There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances about
special irritation.She had good reason to believe that some
owned by her husband in the West Indies, that for many
years under some sort of garnishment for payment of his own
burdens could be recovered by appropriate measures; and this
possession, though not great, would be enough to make it relative
rich.But there was no one to stir it.Mr. Elliot wouldn't do anything
and she couldn't do anything herself, nor was she personally handicapped
effort by her condition of physical weakness, and by employing others through
her lack of money.She didn't even have natural connections to help her
with their advice, and she couldn't afford to buy the help
of the law.This was a cruel aggravation of actually limited resources.To feel that she should be in better circumstances, that a little
problems in the right place could do it, and fear that delay might be ...
even weakening her claims was hard to bear.At this point she had hoped to enlist the good offices of Anne
with Mr. Elliot.She had earlier, in anticipation of their
marriage, was very afraid of losing her boyfriend; but on
be sure that he could not have made an attempt of this nature, since
he didn't even know she was in Bath, it was immediately noticeable that ...
something could be done in her favor by the influence of the woman he
loved, and she had hastily prepared to take an interest in Anne's feelings,
to the extent that due to Mr. Elliot's character, compliance allowed,
when Anne's refutation of the alleged engagement the prestige of
everything; and while it robbed her of the newly formed hope
at least let her succeed in the object of her first fear
comfort to tell the whole story in her own way.After listening to this full description from Mr. Elliot, Anne couldn't
but express some surprise at the fact that Mrs. Smith spoke of him like that...
favorable in the beginning of their conversation.'She had seemed
commend him and praise him!"

'Honey,' was Mrs Smith's reply, 'there was nothing else to do.I took you for sure that you married him, although he may not have done so yet
made the offer, and I could no more tell the truth about him than if he...
had your husband been.My heart was bleeding for you, which I was talking about
luck; and yet he is wise, he is pleasant, and with such one
woman like you it wasn't absolutely hopeless.He was very unkind
his first wife.They were miserable together.But she was too ignorant
and dizzy with respect, and he never loved her.I was willing to
hope you are doing better beter."

Anne could just admit to herself that she could have such a thing
led to marry him, which made her shudder at the idea of ​​the ...
misery that must have followed.It was just possible she would
have been persuaded by Lady Russell! And under such an assumption,
which would have been most miserable if time had also revealed everything
late?

It was very desirable that Lady Russell should no longer be deceived;
and one of the closing arrangements of this important conference,
that they spent most of the morning, was that
Anne had complete freedom to communicate anything relative to her friend
to Mrs. Smith, which involved his behavior.Chapter 22


Anne went home to reflect on everything she had heard.At one point, her
feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr. Elliot.There was no
more tenderness because of him.He stood in contrast to
Captain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome intrusiveness; and evil
of his attention last night, the irreparable evil he might have
was considered with unqualified sensations, not perplexed.Unfortunately
for him it was all over.But this was the only point of relief.In any
different respect, by looking around or penetrating forward, she saw:
more to mistrust and grasp.She was concerned about the
disappointment and pain Lady Russell would feel; for the
mortifications to hang over her father and sister, and
had all the pain of foreseeing much evil, not knowing how
avoid any of them.She was most grateful for her own knowledge of
him.She had never thought herself entitled to a reward for that not
disdain an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was a reward indeed
come from that! Mrs Smith could have told her what no one
could have done otherwise.Could it have expanded knowledge
her family? But this was a vain idea.She needs to talk to Lady Russell
tell her, talk to her, and after doing her best, wait for the event
with as much calmness as possible; and finally its greatest lack of it
calmness would be in that part of the mind that could not be
opened for Lady Russell; in that stream of worries and fears that
be all to themselves.When she got home, she found that she had escaped as planned
seeing Mr. Elliot; that he called and paid them a long morning
visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself and felt safe, when…
she heard he would come again in the evening avonds."I wasn't going to ask him," Elizabeth said
stricken carelessness, "but he gave so many hints," says Mrs. Clay
least."

"Indeed, I'm saying it.I've never seen anyone spell harder in my life
an invitation.Poor man! I was in real pain for him; For you
The hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, looks out for cruelty."

"Oh!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "I've been a little too used to the game
quickly overcome by the hints of a gentleman.However, when I discovered how
he was extremely sorry that he had to miss my father
in the morning I immediately gave in, because I would never really
opportunity to bring him and Sir Walter together.They look like this
much advantage in company with each other.Each behaves like this
pleasant.Mr Elliot looked up with such respect."

"Very delicious!" cried Mrs Clay, but she didn't dare turn her around
eyes turned to Anne."Just like father and son! Dear Mrs. Elliot,
may I not say father and son?"

"Oh! I don't put an embargo on a body's words.If you have such
ideas! But at my word, I am hardly aware of his attention
above that of other men."

"My dear Miss Elliot!" exclaimed Mrs Clay, raising her hands and eyes,
and the rest of her surprise sinking into a pleasant silence."Well, my dear Penelope, you needn't be so afraid of him....I did
invite him, you know?.I sent him away with a smile.When I found him
really went all day to his friends in Thornberry Park
tomorrow i felt sorry for him."

Anne admired the good acting of the girlfriend, by being able to show it
pleasure as she did, in anticipation and in the actual arrival of
the person whose presence should really hinder her
prime object.It was impossible, but Mrs. Clay must have hated the sight
from Mr. Elliot; and yet she could take a very obliging, calm look,
and seem quite pleased with the limited license of dedication
herself only half as much for Sir Walter as she would have done
different-.For Anne herself, it was very troubling to see Mr. Elliot de
room; and quite painful to have him come over and talk to her.She had
used to feel that he couldn't always be quite sincere, but
now she saw insincerity in everything.His thoughtful reverence for her
father, contrary to his former language, was odious; and when they
thought of his cruel behavior towards Mrs Smith, she could hardly bear it
the sight of his present smile and gentleness, or the sound of his
artificial good feelings.She intended to avoid any change of manners that a
protest on his side.It was a big goal for her to escape everything alles
research or eclat; but her intention was to be so decidedly cool
him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to ascertain, if
as quiet as she could, the few steps of needless intimacy she had
gradually led along.She was guarded more and more accordingly
cool, than she had been the night before.He wanted to rekindle her curiosity about how and where he could
heard her praised before; really wanted to be satisfied by
more invitation; but the charm was broken: he discovered that the heat and
animation of a public space was needed to ignite that of its humble cousin
vanity; he thought, at least, that it shouldn't be done now, by any of...
those attempts he could venture under the all too impressive claims of
the others.Little did he suspect it was a subject that was now acting
exactly against his interest, immediately stirring everything to her mind
those parts of his behavior that were the least excusable.She had some satisfaction when she found out that he was really leaving
Pray the next morning, go early, and that he would be gone weg
a larger part of two days.He was invited again to Camden Place the
the evening of his return; but from Thursday to Saturday night
absence was certain.It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay would be
always for her; but that there is a deeper hypocrite to them
party, the destruction of everything seemed like peace and comfort.It
was so humiliating to think about the constant deceit applied to
her father and Elizabeth; to the different sources of
prepare mortification for them! Mrs. Clay's selfishness wasn't like that
neither complicated nor as revolting as his; and Anne would have compensated
marriage right away, with all its evils, to be away from Mr Elliot's
subtleties in trying to avoid it.On Friday morning she planned to go to Lady Russell very early, and...
establish the necessary communications; and she would have gone
right after breakfast, but that Mrs. Clay went out a little too
obliging purpose to save her sister from trouble, which made her decide to
wait until she might be safe from such a companion.She saw Mrs. Clay
so pretty off before she started talking about spending the morning
in Rivers Street."All right then," said Elizabeth, "I have nothing to send but my dear ....Oh!
you might as well take back that tiring book she'd lend me, and
pretend i read it.I really can't tease myself for that
ever with all the new poems and states of the nation coming out.Lady Russell is quite bored with her new publications.You do not have to
tell her, but I thought her dress was awful recently.I used
to think she had taste in clothes, but I was ashamed of her at the
concert.Something so formal and arranged in her air! and she's like this
upright! My dear love of course."

'And mine,' added Sir Walter."Regards.And you can say that
I plan to call her soon.Make a civil message; but i will be alone
leave my card.Morning visits are never fair by women in her time of
life that make themselves so small.If only she would wear rouge
she wouldn't be afraid to be seen; but the last time I called, me
noted that the blinds were immediately abandoned."

As her father spoke, there was a knock on the door.Who could do it?
turn into? Anne, recalling the scheduled visits, at all times, of Mr.
Elliot, would have expected him, but seven for his known engagement
miles away.After the usual period of tension, the usual sounds of
the approach was heard, and "Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove" were ushered in
in the room.Surprise was the strongest emotion aroused by their appearance; but Anne
was really happy to see them; and the others weren't so sorry, but that
they could take on a decent air of welcome; and as soon as it became
clear that these, their closest relatives, had not arrived with anyone
view of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were
able to ascend in cordiality, and to do the honor thereof very well.They
had come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were at the...
White Hart.That much was understood quite quickly; but to Sir Walter
and Elizabeth walked Mary into the other sitting room, and
while they treated themselves to her admiration, Anne could not rely on
Charles' brain for a regular history of their arrival, or a
explanation of some smiling hints of certain things that had
ostentatiously dropped by Mary, as well as by some apparent ones
confusion about who made up their party.She then discovered that it consisted of Mrs. Musgrove, Henrietta and...
Captain Harville, next to their two selves.He gave her a very clear,
comprehensible report of the whole; a story in which she saw a great groot
deal of the most characteristic procedure.The scheme had been
first impulse from Captain Harville who wants to come to Bath on ...
company.He started talking about it a week ago; and by doing
something, when the shooting was over, Charles had suggested going with him,
and Mrs. Harville seemed to really like the idea of ​​it, since a...
benefit to her husband; but Mary could not bear to be left behind, and she had
was so unhappy about it, that for a day or two everything
seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.But then it was recorded
by his father and mother.His mother had some old friends in Bath who ...
she wanted to see; it was seen as a good chance for Henrietta to
come and buy wedding clothes for herself and her sister; and, in short,
it ended in his mother's feast, which might be anything
comfortable and convenient for Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included
therein by way of general convenience.They had arrived late at night
before.Mrs. Harville, her children, and Captain Benwick stayed with ...
Mr. Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross.Anne's only surprise was that things had to be soon enough
to talk about Henrietta's wedding clothes.She had imagined something like this
difficulties of fortune to exist there, as marriage should occur
be up close; but she learned that very much from Charles
recently, (since Mary's last letter to herself), Charles Hayter
requested by a friend to earn a living for a young person who couldn't
possibly claim over many years; and that on the strength of him
current income, with almost a certainty of something more permanent
long before the term in question, the two families had agreed to the
wishes of young people, and that their marriage is likely to take place
in a few months, as fast as Louisa's."And a very good life in it
was, "added Charles," only twenty-five miles from Uppercross, and ...
in a very beautiful country: beautiful part of Dorsetshire.In the middle of
some of the best preserves in the kingdom, surrounded by three large ones
owners, the one more cautious and jealous than the other; and up to two
of the three at least, Charles Hayter could get a special
recommendation.Not that he'll appreciate it the way it should, 'he noted,
Charles is too cool about sports.That's the worst of him."

'I am indeed very happy,' cried Anne, 'extremely happy that this
should happen; and those of two sisters, who both earn equally well,
and who have always been such good friends, the pleasant prospect of
one shouldn't dim the other's - they should be
equal in their prosperity and comfort.I hope your mom and dad
are quite happy with both."

"Oh yes.My father would be very happy if the gentlemen were
richer, but he has no other fault to be found.Money, you know, is coming
with money - two daughters at the same time - it can't be very pleasant
surgery, and it makes him tighter in many ways.But I don't
means they have no right.It's very fit they should
have subsidiary shares; and I'm sure he's always been very nice,
liberal father to me.Mary no longer likes Henrietta's match.She never did, you know.But she doesn't do him justice, nor does she think
enough about Winthrop.I can't force her to value it
property.It's a very fair game, as times go by; and i liked
Charles Hayter all my life, and I will not stop now."

"Such excellent parents as Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove," exclaimed Anne,
"must be happy in their children's marriages".They do everything they can to
good luck, I'm sure.What a blessing for young people to be inside
such hands! Your mom and dad seem so totally free of all those things
ambitious feelings that have led to so much misconduct and misery,
both for young and old.I hope you think Louisa has recovered perfectly
now?"

He answered rather hesitantly, "Yes, I think so, very much
restored; but she has changed; there is no running or jumping, no
laughing or dancing; it is very different.If only one happens with
close the door a little hard, she starts and squirms like a kid
dab chick in the water; and Benwick sits at her elbow reading verses,
or whispering to her all day long."

Anne laughed.'You can't taste that much, I do
know," she said, "but I believe he is an excellent young man."

"To make sure he is.No one doubts it; and I hope you don't think I am
so illiberal I want every man to have the same objects and
pleasures like myself.I have great value to Benwick; and when one?
can only get him talking, he's got plenty to say.His reading has done
no harm to him, for he has fought as well as read.He's a brave guy.Last Monday I got to know him better than ever before.We
had a famous setup all morning to go rat hunting in my dad's big
sanding; and he played his part so well that I liked him all the better
since."

Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles
the others follow to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had heard
enough to understand and rejoice in the current state of Uppercross
his luck; and though she sighed as she rejoiced, she had no sigh
of the ill will of envy in it.She would definitely have gone up to them
blessings if she could, but she didn't want to diminish theirs.The visit went completely in a good mood?.Mary was inside
excellent spirits, enjoying the merriment and the change, and so well
pleased with the journey in her mother-in-law's carriage with four
horses, and with its own complete independence from Camden Place, that
she was just in the mood to admire everything as she should, and
most readily enter into all the superiorities of the house, like them
were detailed to her.She made no demands on her father or sister, and
her entourage was enhanced just enough by their handsome ones
salons.Elizabeth suffered, for a short time, much.She felt that
Mrs. Musgrove and all her party should be asked to dine with them; but
she could not bear the difference in style, the reduction of
servants, who must betray a dinner, witness those who had been
always so inferior to Kellynch's Elliots.It was a struggle
between decency and vanity; but vanity got better, and then
Elizabeth was happy again.These were her internal beliefs: "Old
old-fashioned concepts; rural hospitality; we claim not to give
dinners; few people in Bath do that; Lady Alicia never does; didn't even
ask her own sister's family, even though they were here for a month: and I dare
say it would be very annoying for Mrs. Musgrove; put her out properly
her way.I'm sure she'd rather not come; she cannot feel comfortable
with us.I'll ask them all for an evening; that will be much better;
that will be a novelty and a treat.They haven't seen two yet
salons before.They will be happy to come tomorrow
evening.It will be an ordinary party, small, but very elegant."And
this pleased Elizabeth: and when the invitation was given to the two
present, and promised for the absent, Mary was just as fully satisfied.In particular, she was asked to meet Mr. Elliot and get to know Lady
Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, who were happily engaged to
come; and she couldn't have gotten more satisfying attention.Miss Elliot would have the honor of visiting Mrs Musgrove in the
course of the morning; and Anne ran away with Charles and Mary, to go
and see her and Henrietta directly.Her plan to sit with Lady Russell has to make way for the present.All three of them called Rivers Street for a few minutes; but
Anne convinced herself that a day's delay in the intended communication
couldn't matter, and hurried to the White Heart, to ...
see again last fall's friends and companions, with a
eagerness of goodwill to which many associations have contributed.They found Mrs. Musgrove and her daughter inside, and alone, and
Anne was warmly welcomed by each.Henrietta was right in there
state of recently improved attitudes, of newly formed happiness, through which
her full of respect and interest for everyone she ever liked
all the way; and Mrs Musgrove's real affection was won by her haar
useful when they were in need.It was cordiality, and a
warmth and a sincerity that Anne enjoyed all the more, from the sad
lack of such blessings at home.She was requested to give them so much
of her time possible, invited every day and all day long, or
previously claimed as part of the family; and in return of course
fell in all her usual ways of attention and help, and so on
Charles left them together, listened to Mrs. Musgrove's...
history of Louisa, and to Henrietta's of herself, who expresses opinions about
business, and recommendations to stores; intermittent of any help
Mary needed, from changing her ribbon to paying her bills;
from finding her keys and sorting her trinkets to trying to…
convince her that she has not been used badly by anyone; which Mary, well
as amused as she was in general, in her station by a window overlooking the
access to the pump room, couldn't help but have her moments of imagination.A morning of profound confusion was to be expected.A big party in
a hotel created a rapidly changing, restless scene.A five minutes
brought a note, the next a package; and Anne had not been there halfway
hour, when their dining room, spacious as it was, shone more than half way
filled: a group of steady old friends sat around Mrs. Musgrove,
and Charles returned with captains Harville and Wentworth.The
appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the
moment.It was impossible for her to forget to feel this
arrival of their mutual friends should bring them together soon
again.Their last meeting had been the most important in opening his…
feelings; she had derived a wonderful conviction from it; but they
feared by his appearance, which had the same unfortunate belief that he had
rushed him away from the Concert Room, still ruled.He didn't
seem to want to be close enough for a conversation.She tried to be calm and let things take their course, and tried
to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence: 'Sure, if
there is a constant attachment on both sides, our heart must understand
each other soon.We are not boy and girl, to be enchanting
irritable, deceived by the inattention of every moment and wanton play
with our own luck.'And yet, a few minutes later, she felt
as if they were in company with each other, beneath their present
circumstances, can only expose them to inattention and
misconstructions of the most mischievous kind."Anne," Mary called, still at her window, "there is Mrs. Clay, I'm sure.
standing under the colonnade, and a lord by her.i saw them
now turn the corner of Bath Street.They seemed deep in conversation.Who is it? Come and tell me.Good heavens! I remember.It's sir
Elliot himself."

“No,” Anne shouted quickly, “it can't be Mr. Elliot, I assure you.He
was due to leave Bath at nine this morning and will not be back until then
tomorrow."

As she spoke, she felt Captain Wentworth look at her, the ...
the awareness of it annoyed and embarrassed her, and made her regret it
that she had said so much, no matter how simple it was.Mary, who blamed she was supposed to not know her own niece,
began to talk very warmly about the family characteristics and protested
even more positive that it was Mr Elliot, who again called upon Anne to…
come and see for yourself, but Anne didn't want to move and tried
be cool and carefree.However, her grief returned to the sighting
smiles and intelligent looks go between two or three of the lady
visitors, as if they believed in secret.It was
clear that the message about her had spread, and a short pause
succeeded, which seemed to ensure that it would now spread further."Come on, Anne," cried Mary, "come and see for yourself.You too
leave if you are not in a hurry.They are getting divorced; they vibrate
hands.He turns away.I don't know Mr. Elliot! you seem too
I completely forgot about Lyme."

To pacify Mary, and perhaps to shield her own embarrassment, Anne moved
quietly to the window.She was just in time to determine that it was
really Mr. Elliot was, which she never believed, before he...
disappeared on one side, while Mrs. Clay quickly walked away on the other;
and controlling the amazement she could only feel in such a moment
appearance of friendly conference between two persons of total
interests, she said calmly, "Yes, it is definitely Mr. Elliot ....He's changed his hour of departure, I think, that's all, or maybe...
mistaken, I might not be there; ”and walked back to her chair,
reconstituted, and with the comfortable hope of acquitting himself
good.The visitors said goodbye; and Charles, who had seen them politely...
out, and then pulled a face at them, and abused them before their coming began
with--

"Well, mother, I did something for you that you will like".I
went to the theater and secured a box for tomorrow night.Ant
Am I a good boy? I know you like a play; and there is room for all of us.It contains nine.I got Captain Wentworth engaged.Anne won't be
sorry to join us, i'm sure.We all love a play.Didn't I?
well, mother? "

Mrs. Musgrove started in a good mood and began to express her perfectly volmaakt
readiness for the play, if Henrietta and everyone else liked it, when
Mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming:

'Good heavens, Charles! How can you come up with such a thing? Grab a box
for tomorrow night! Did you forget we're engaged to Camden
Room for tomorrow night? and that we were mainly asked to meet
Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr. Elliot, and the whole principal
family ties, intentionally to be introduced to them? How can you be?
so forgetful? "

"Phoo! Phoo!" replied Charles, "what is an evening party? Never worth it"
to remind.Your dad might have asked us out for dinner, I think, if he did
wanted to see us.You can do whatever you want, but I'm going to the
play."

"Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too gruesome if you do, if you
promised to go."

"No, I didn't promise.I just grinned and bowed, and said the word
'happy.'There was no promise'."

'But you must go, Charles.It would be unforgivable to fail.We were
expressly asked to be introduced.There was always such a wonderful thing
connection between the Dalrymples and ourselves.Nothing ever happened
this was not immediately announced on either side.We're almost there
relationships, you know; and also Mr. Elliot, to whom you should be so special...
are familiar with! All attention is due to Mr Elliot.To consider,
my father's heir: the future representative of the family."

"Don't talk to me about heirs and representatives," Charles shouted."I
am not one of those who neglect the ruling power to bow to the insurrection?
Sun.If I didn't go for your dad's sake, I'd think it ...
outrageous to go for the sake of his heir.What is Mr. Elliot to me? '
The carefree expression was life to Anne, who saw that Captain
Wentworth was all the attention, watching and listening with all of his soul;
and that the last words are Charles's inquiring eyes to ...
herself.Charles and Mary still spoke in the same style; he, half seriously
and half-joking, keeping the schedule for the play, and she,
invariably serious, very warm to it, and do not fail to make
it knew that no matter how determined she was to go to Camden Place herself, she ...
shouldn't find themselves very well used when going to the play
without hair.Mrs Musgrove intervened.“We better postpone it.Charles, you better go back
change the box for tuesday.It would be a shame to be divided, and we
Miss Anne should also lose when there is a party with her father;
and I'm sure that neither Henrietta nor I should take care of the play,
if Miss Anne couldn't be with us."

Anne felt really obliged to her because of that kindness; and just as much
for the opportunity it gave her to say decisively:

"If only my inclination depended, ma'am, the party at home...
(except for Mary's account) wouldn't be the slightest hindrance.I
don't enjoy the kind of meeting, and would love to
change it for a play, and with you.But it better not be
tried, maybe."She had spoken it, but she trembled when it...
done, aware that her words were being listened to, and didn't even dare
try to observe their effect.Soon there was general agreement that Tuesday would be the day; Charles
he only reserves the advantage of still teasing his wife, by persisting
that he would go to the play tomorrow when no one else did.Captain Wentworth left his chair and walked to the fireplace; probably
to walk away from it shortly after and a
station, with less bare design, by Anne.“You haven't been in Bath long enough,” he said, “to enjoy the evening
celebrations of the place."

"Oh no.The usual character of them has nothing for me.I am not
card player."

"You weren't before, I know".You used to not like cards; but
time makes many changes."

"I haven't changed that much yet," Anne cried, stopping, fearing she might...
hardly knew any misconstruction.After waiting a few moments, he said:
and as if it were the result of an immediate feeling, "It is a period,
indeed! Eight and a half years is a period."

Whether he would have gone further was left to Anne's imagination
to think about in a quieter hour; because while he still hears the sounds he
had said, she was startled by other topics by Henrietta, who was eager to…
take advantage of the current free time to go out and visit her
companions so as not to lose time, lest anyone else enter.They had to move.Anne said she was all set, and
tried to look at it; but she had the feeling that Henrietta de
regret and unwillingness of her heart in leaving that chair, in the preparation
to leave the room she would have found in all her own feelings
her cousin, in the assurance of his affection, with pity
her.However, their preparations were halted.Alarming sounds were
heard; other visitors approached, and the door was flung open for Sir
Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give a general shiver.Anne felt immediate oppression, and everywhere she looked she saw symptoms
of the same.The comfort, the freedom, the cheerfulness of the room was
past, dumb in cold calm, determined silence, or dull talk,
to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.How
humbling to feel that it was!

Her jealous eye was very pleased in one.Captain Wentworth was
recognized again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.She even spoke to him once and looked at him more than once.In fact, Elizabeth was spinning tremendously.The sequel
explained it.After the waste of a few minutes to say the right thing
nothing, she began to give the invitation that would include everything
the remaining contribution of the Musgroves.'Tomorrow night, to meet a couple
friends: no formal party.“It was all said very gracefully, and the ...
cards she'd given herself, Miss Elliot's home,
were placed on the table, with a courteous, all-encompassing smile at everyone,
and a smile and a card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.The
the truth was that Elizabeth had been in Bath long enough to understand
the importance of a man with such a look and appearance as his.Past
was nothing.The gift was that Captain Wentworth would move
good at her salon.The card was emphatically given, and Sir Walter
and Elizabeth got up and disappeared.The interruption had been brief, but serious, and easy and brisk
returned to most of those they left behind when the door shut them out, but not
to Anne.She could only think of the invitation she had with such a
astonishment witness, and of the way it had been
received; a way of questionable meaning, of surprise instead of
satisfaction, of lived recognition instead of acceptance.They
knew him; she saw contempt in his eyes and couldn't believe it
that he had decided to accept such a sacrifice, as an atonement for ...
all the brutality of the past.Her courage sank.He held the card
his hand after they were gone, as if he was thinking deeply about it."Just think of Elizabeth's including everyone else!" Mary whispered very much
audible."I'm not surprised Captain Wentworth is delighted! See him ...
can't knock the card out of his hand."

Anne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth formed itself
in a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away that she ...
could see or hear no more to torment her.The party separated.The gentlemen had their own activities, the ladies
went on with their own business, and they stopped meeting while Anne
belonged to them.She was sincerely begged to come back and have dinner, and
give them the rest of the day, but it took so long
practiced that she felt unequal to more at this point, and only fit for
at home, where she can be sure she will be as quiet as she wanted.Promising to be with them the next morning,
so she closed the fatigues of the present with an arduous walk to
Camden Place, there to spend the evening mainly listening to the
busy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs. Clay for tomorrow's party, the
frequent enumeration of the invited persons, and the continuous
improving the details of any embellishments that would make it
most completely elegant of its kind in Bath, while harassing herself
with the never-ending question of Captain Wentworth coming zou
or not? They counted him as sure, but with her it was a ...
nagging concerns were never met for five minutes together.They
generally thought he would come because she generally thought he
should; but it was a case that she could not shape so positively
act of duty or discretion, as inevitable to refute the suggestions of
very opposite feelings.She awoke alone from the brooding of this restless excitement,
to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot for three hours
after he was supposed to be out of Bath, because he had watched in vain
for an indication of the lady interview herself, she
determined to call it, and it seemed to her that there was guilt in madam
Clay's face as she listened.It was transient: tidy in one
instantaneously; but Anne could imagine that she was aware of it
have, by a complication of mutual trick, or an overbearing one
authority of his, was obliged to be present (maybe for half an hour)
his readings and limitations on her designs about Sir Walter.They
cried, however, with a very acceptable mimicry of nature:

"Oh! Honey! Very true.Just think, Miss Elliot, much to my surprise that I...
a meeting with Mr Elliot in Bath Street.I was never so surprised.He
turned and walked with me to the Pump Yard.He was unable to attend
on my way to Thornberry, but I really forgot by what; because I was in a
hurry me, and couldn't attend much, and I can only answer for his being
determined not to delay his return.He wanted to know how
early he could be admitted tomorrow.He was full of 'tomorrow', and
It's very clear that I'm full of it too, since I
went into the house and learned the extension of your plan and all that
happened, otherwise I would never have been able to see him completely ...
my head."



Chapter 23


Only one day had passed since Anne's conversation with Mrs. Smith; but one
a greater interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched by Mr.
Elliot's behavior, except for the securities in a quarter, that it became ...
a matter of course the next morning, even to postpone her explanation
visit in Rivers Street.She had promised to join the Musgroves
breakfast to dinner.Her faith had been sworn, and Mr. Elliot's ...
character, like the head of the sultaness Scheherazade, must live another
day.However, she could not keep her appointment punctually; the weather was
unfavorable, and she had mourned the rain on her friends'
account, and felt very alone before she could
try the walk.When she reached the White Hart and headed for ...
the right apartment, she noticed she didn't arrive quite on time,
nor the first to arrive.The company before her was, Mrs. Musgrove,
talking to Mrs. Croft, and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and
she immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait,
left the moment it cleared but would come back soon,
and that the strictest orders were left to Mrs Musgrove
keep her there until they get back.All she had to do was submit, sit down,
be outwardly controlled, and immediately feel immersed in everything
agitations that she had only stated she tasted a little
closed for the morning.There was no delay, no time wasted.They
was deep in the happiness of such misery, or its misery
happiness, immediately.Two minutes after she entered the room, Captain
Wentworth said--

"We'll write the letter we talked about now, Harville, if you like."
will give me materials."

Materials were available, on a separate table; he went there, and almost...
he turned his back on them all, was absorbed in writing.Mrs. Musgrove told Mrs. Croft the story of her eldest daughter
involvement, and just in that awkward tone that was:
perfectly audible while pretending to be a whisper.Anne felt that
she wasn't part of the conversation, and yet, like Captain Harville
seemed thoughtful and disinclined to talk, she couldn't avoid hearing
many unwanted details; like, "how Mr. Musgrove and my brother"
Hayter had met over and over to talk about it; what my brother Hayter
had said one day, and what Mr. Musgrove had suggested the next, and what
had occurred to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished,
and what I said at first I could never agree, but after that was...
persuaded to think it could do very well," and many at the same time
style of candid communication: details that, even with each
advantage of taste and delicacy, which a good Mrs Musgrove could not
could actually only be of interest to clients.Mrs. Croft
was present in great good humor, and when she spoke at all, it
was very sensible.Anne hoped the gentlemen would all be too much
confident to hear."And so, ma'am, all these things considered," Mrs. Musgrove said to her
strong whisper, 'although we could have wished otherwise,
all in all, we thought it was unfair to stand out any longer, because
Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was pretty close
just as bad; and so we thought they better get married right away, and the ...
the best of it, as many others have done before them.Anyway, I said
it will be better than a long engagement."

"That's exactly what I was going to observe," cried Mrs. Croft."I
prefer that young people settle with a small income in one go, and
struggling along with some difficulties, then in being involved
a long engagement.I always think no reciprocal ... "

"Oh! Dear Mrs. Croft," shouted Mrs. Musgrove, unable to get her killed
speech, "There is nothing that I detest young people as much as a tall one
engagement.I have always protested against that for my children.It
is all very good, I always said, for young people to be involved, if
there is a certainty that they can get married in six months, or
even in twelve; but a long engagement ... "

'Yes, ma'am,' said Mrs. Croft, 'or a precarious engagement, and...
involvement that can last a long time.To start without knowing it on such a
time there will be the opportunity to get married, I consider very unsafe and
unwise, and what I think all parents should avoid as much as possible."

Anne found an unexpected interest here.She felt its application to
herself, felt it over her in a nervous excitement; and at the same time
moment her eyes instinctively looked at the table in the distance,
Captain Wentworth's pen stopped moving, his head went up, paused,
listening, and he turned the next moment to glance, a
quick, conscious look at her.The two ladies continued to talk, to insist again on the same admitted truths,
and enforce them with such examples of the ill-effects of a contrary
practice as was within their perception, but Anne heard nothing
clearly; it was just a buzz of words in her ear, her mind was in it
confusion.Captain Harville, who had not actually heard of it, was now leaving
his chair, and went to a window, and Anne seemed to be watching him, however
it was through a profound absence of mind, gradually the realization that he
invited her to join him where he was standing.He looked at her with a
smile, and a small movement of the head, which expressed: "Come to me, I
have something to say;" and the untainted, easygoing friendliness of the way
denoting the feelings of an acquaintance older than he really was,
strongly enforced the invitation.She woke up and went to him.The window he stood in front of was on the other side of the room
where the two ladies were, and though closer to the captain
Wentworth's table, not very close?.When she joined him, Captain
Harville's face regained its serious, thoughtful expression
which seemed to be his natural character."Look here," he said, unfolding a package in his hand and a ...
small miniature painting, "do you know who that is?"

"Certainly: Captain Benwick."

'Yes, and you can guess who it is for.But "(in a deep tone)" it was
not done for her.Miss Elliot, do you remember when we walked together
Lyme, and mourning for him? I didn't think much at the time, but it doesn't matter.This was signed at the Cape.He met a smart young German artist
at the Cape, and in accordance with a promise to my poor sister, sat at ...
him, and brought it home for her; and I now have the charge of
set it right for someone else! It was an assignment for me! But
who else was there to hire? I hope I can allow him.I am not
sorry, indeed, to transfer it to someone else.He undertakes it; "(looking for
to Captain Wentworth,) "he's writing about it now."And with a
trembling lip, he rounded it off by adding: 'Poor Fanny! she would
don't forget him so soon!"

"No," Anne replied in a low, feeling voice."I can do that easily
to believe."

"It was not in her nature".She adored him."

'It wouldn't be the nature of a woman who really loved."

Captain Harville smiled as much as to say, “Are you claiming that for you?
sex?" and she answered the question, also smiling, "Yes.We sure
don't forget when you forget us.It may be our fate
instead of our merit.We cannot help ourselves.We live at home
quiet, limited and our feelings prey on us.You are forced
effort.You always have a profession, occupation, business of some
kind or other, to bring you back into the world immediately, and
constant occupation and change quickly weaken impressions."

"Accept your claim that the world is doing all this so quickly for men"
(which I don't think I'll allow though), it doesn't apply to
Benwick.He has not been forced to make any effort.The peace has returned
him ashore right now, and he has lived with us, in us
small family circle, ever since."

'That's true,' said Anne, 'very true; I didn't remember, but what shall we
say now, Captain Harville? If the change is not from the outside:
circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature, the nature of man,
who did the business for Captain Benwick."

"No, no, it's not the nature of man".I will not allow it to belong to more men
nature than that of the woman to be capricious and forget those they love, or
have loved.I believe the opposite.I believe in a true analogy
between our physical constitution and our mental; and that as our bodies are
the strongest, such are our feelings; able to bear the most rough
use and ride in the toughest weather."

"Your feelings may be the strongest," replied Anne, "but the same ...
spirit of analogy will empower me to say that ours are the most
registration.The man is more robust than the woman, but he is no longer alive;
which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.No, it would be too hard for you if it were otherwise.You have
difficulties and hardships and dangers enough to struggle with.YOU
are always working and toil, exposed to every risk and hardship.Leaving your home, country, friends, all.Neither time nor health,
nor life, to be called your own.It would be difficult indeed" (with a
faltering voice), "if the woman's feelings were added to all this"."

"We will never agree on this question," said Captain Harville
start to say, when a soft sound drew their attention to Captain?
Wentworth's so far perfectly quiet room layout.It was
nothing more than that his pen had fallen; but Anne was shocked
in finding him closer than she imagined, and half inclined to ...
suspect that the pen had only fallen because it had been busy with
them, trying to catch sounds she didn't think he could
have caught."Have you finished your letter?" said Captain Harville Har."Not quite, just a few more lines.I'll be ready in five minutes."

"There is no rush on my side.I'm only ready when you are.I am
in very good anchorage here, "(smiling at Anne)," well supplied, and
want for nothing.No rush for a signal.Well, Miss Elliot,'
(softer his voice) "Like I said, we'll never agree, I suppose,
on this point.No man and woman probably would.But let me
notice that all histories are against you - all stories, prose and ...
fresh.If I had a memory like Benwick I could bring you fifty
quotes in a moment on my side the argument, and I don't think I am
ever opened a book in my life that had nothing to say
fickleness of the woman.Songs and proverbs, all talk about women
fickleness.But you may say these are all written by men."

"Maybe I'll.Yes, yes, if you prefer, no reference to examples in it
books.Men have had all the benefits from us in telling their own story.They have been educated to a much higher degree; the pen has been
in their hands.I don't allow books to prove anything."

"But how are we going to prove anything?"

"We will never do that".We can never expect to prove anything on such
point.It's a disagreement that yields no proof.We probably all start with a little preference for our own gender; and
on that bias every circumstance builds in favor of it that has
took place in our own circle; many of what circumstances (maybe
just those cases that strike us the most) may be exactly like
cannot be brought forward without breaching a trust, or in some cases
respect saying what should not be said."

"Ah!" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling, "if I could...
but let you understand what a man suffers when he looks at it one last time
his wife and children, and watch the boat he sent them
inside, as long as it's in sight, and then turn around and say, “God knows
if we ever meet again!' And then, if I give you it
glow of his soul when he sees them again; when, coming back after a
absence of twelve months perhaps, and obliged to call at another port,
he calculates how fast it is possible to get them there while pretending...
cheats on himself and says, "They can't be here until such a day," but
all the while hoping for them twelve hours earlier, and seeing them
finally arrive, as if heaven had given them wings many hours earlier
still! If I could explain all this to you, and all that a man can endure
and do, and boast of doing, for the sake of these treasures of his
to exist! I speak, you know, only of men who have hearts!"
pressure his with emotion."Oh!" Anne cried eagerly, "I hope I do justice to everything that is felt by ...
you, and by those who look like you.God forbid I would do that
undervalue the warm and loyal feelings of one of mine
fellow beings! I would deserve utter contempt if I dared
suppose that true attachment and steadfastness were known only to the woman.No, I believe you are capable of all that is great and good in your marriage
lives.I believe you are equal to any major effort, and to any
domestic tolerance, as long as - as I may be allowed the
expression - as long as you have an object.I mean while the woman you
love lives and lives for you.All the privilege that I claim for myself
sex (it's not very enviable; you don't have to covet it), is that of
to love longest, when existence or when hope is gone."

She couldn't have uttered a different sentence right away; her heart was
too full, her breath too much suppressed."You are a good soul," cried Captain Harville, putting his hand on her
poor, very loving."There is no quarrel with you.And
when I think of Benwick my tongue is tied."

Their attention was drawn to the others.Mrs. Croft took
leave."Here, Frederick, you and I are breaking up, I believe," she said ...."I am
go home, and you have an appointment with your friend your.Tonight we have
may have the pleasure of meeting again at your company, '(turning to
Anne.) "We had your sister's card yesterday, and I understood
Frederick had a map too, although I didn't see it; and you are
off, Frederick, aren't you as good as we are?"

Captain Wentworth folded a letter in great haste, and neither did
was unable or unwilling to answer completely."Yes," he said, "very true; here we part, but Harville and I will...
soon after you; that is, Harville, when you're ready, I'll be in half an hour
minute.I know you won't regret leaving.i will be with you
service in half a minute."

Mrs. Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, who had sealed his letter...
with great speed, was indeed ready, and had even rushed, agitated
air, showing impatience that it was gone.Anne didn't know how
Understand it.She had the kindest "Good morning, God bless you!" from
Captain Harville, but not a word from him, not a look! He passed
out of the room without looking!

However, she only had time to move closer to the table where he was standing
write, when footsteps were heard coming back; the door opened, it is
wash himself.He begged their forgiveness, but he forgot his gloves,
and instantly across the room to the writing-table, he drew a trok
letter from under the scattered paper, put it in front of Anne with eyes
of a glowing plea that was directed at her for a time and hastily gathered his
gloves, was out of the room again, almost before Mrs. Musgrove knew it
of his being in it: the work of a moment!

The revolution that Anne had made in an instant was almost over
expression.The letter, with a barely legible direction, to "Miss A.IS.--" was apparently the one he had folded so hastily.Although he should have written only to Captain Benwick, he had been
address her! Everything depended on the contents of that letter
world could do for her.Everything was possible, everything could be
defied instead of tension.Mrs. Musgrove had few arrangements for it
her own at her own table; she must rely on their protection, and
sinking into the seat he had occupied, and succeeded
where he had leaned and written, her eyes devoured the following
words:


"I can no longer listen in silence".I have to speak to you that way
like being within my reach.You pierce my soul.I'm half hurt, half
hope.Don't tell me I'm late, such precious feelings ...
gone forever.I offer myself to you again with a heart even more yours
then owned it when you nearly broke it eight and a half ago.To dare
say not that the man forgets before the woman, that his love is a
previous death.I have not loved anyone but you.I may have been unjust
I have been weak and resentful, but never unstable.You alone have
took me to Bath.For you alone, I think and plan.did not you?
seen this? Could you not have understood my wishes? I did not have
waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think
you must have penetrated mine.I can hardly write.I am every moment
hear something that overpowers me.Your voice is sinking, but I can
discern the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.Being too good, too excellent! You do us justice, indeed.You do
believe that there is true attachment and steadfastness among men.To believe
it is the most fiery, most unwavering, in F.IN.'I must go, unsure of my fate; but I will return here or follow
your party, as soon as possible.A word, a look, is enough
decide whether I will come into your father's house tonight or never."


Such a letter would not soon be found from.Half an hour
loneliness and reflection might have calmed her; but the ten
minutes that now passed before it was interrupted, in all
her situation's limitations, could not help calm.Every moment previously brought new excitement.It was overwhelming
luck.And before she was past the first stage of full
sensation Charles, Mary and Henrietta all entered.The absolute necessity to resemble oneself then produced a
immediate struggle; but after a while she couldn't do anymore.she started
not to understand a word they said, and were obliged to plead
period and apologizes.They could see then that she was looking
very sick, were shocked and worried, and wouldn't move without her
for the world.This was horrible.If only they would have left, and
left her in the silent possession of that room, it would have been her
to cure; but to have them all standing around her or waiting was…
distracting and desperate, she said she was going home."Anyway, my dear," cried Mrs. Musgrove, "go home at once, and...
take care of yourself so that you are fit for the evening.if i want
Sarah was here to doctor you, but I'm not a doctor myself.Charles, bel
and order a seat.She is not allowed to walk."

But the chair would never work.Worse than all! To lose the opportunity
two words to speak to Captain Wentworth in her silence,
lonely progress through town (and she felt almost certain she would meet)
him) could not be worn.The chair was seriously protested against,
and Mrs. Musgrove, who only thought of one kind of illness, which...
assured himself with some concern that there would be no fall in the
case; that Anne hadn't slipped and been hit lately
on her head; that she was absolutely convinced that she had not fallen;
was able to say goodbye to her cheerfully and confident that she would find her better
night.Concerned not to miss any possible precaution, Anne struggled, saying:

"I'm afraid, ma'am, it's not fully understood".Pray it is so
good to say to the other gentlemen we hope to see you
whole party tonight.I'm afraid a mistake has been made; and
I particularly wish you to assure Captain Harville and Captain
Wentworth, that we hope to see them both."

"Oh! My dear, it is perfectly understood, I give you my word.Captain
Harville has no thought but to go."

"Do you think so? But I'm afraid; and I would be very sorry ....Will you promise to tell me if you see them again? You will
see them both this morning dare I say.Promise me anyway."

"To make sure I will, if you want to.Charles, if you see Captain...
Harville wherever, don't forget to give Miss Anne's message.But indeed,
my love you don't have to worry.Captain Harville keeps calm
engaged, I'll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare
say."

Anne couldn't do more; but her heart prophesied some mischief
the perfection of her bliss.However, it cannot be very permanent.Even if he didn't come to Camden Place himself, it would be in her
power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville.Another
momentary annoyance arose.Charles, in his genuine concern and good
nature, would go home with her; there was no reason to stop him.This was
almost cruel.But she couldn't be ungrateful for long; he sacrificed
a betrothal to a gunsmith, to be of use to her; and she left
with him, with no feeling but gratitude clear.They were on Union Street, then a faster step behind, something like...
familiar sound, gave her two moments of preparation for the sight of
Captain Wentworth.He joined them; but, as if it decides to do it or not
join or pass on, said nothing, just looked.Anne could command
itself enough to receive that look, and not disgusting.the cheeks
that had been pale, now glowed, and the movements that had hesitated...
were decided.He walked next to her.Soon hit by a sudden
thought, Charles said...

"Captain Wentworth, which way are you going? Only to Gay Street, or...
further into town? '

"I hardly know," replied Captain Wentworth in surprise.Are you going as high as Belmont? Are you going near Camden Place?
Because if you are, I won't have any qualms about asking you to take mine
instead, and give Anne your arm to her father's door.She's pretty ready
because this morning, and I mustn't go that far without help, and I should
be on the market with that guy.He promised me the sight of one
capital pistol that he is just going to send; said he would keep it
unpacked until the last possible moment that I should see it; and if i do
Don't turn back now, I have no chance.By its description, a good deal
like the second bar double barrel of mine you shot with one day
round Winthrop."

No objection could be raised.There can only be the most appropriate
enthusiasm, a very obligatory observance for public opinion; and laughs in check
in and ghosts dance in private rapture.In half a minute, Charles
was down Union Street again, and the other two continued andere
together: and soon enough words had passed between them to decide
their direction to the relatively quiet and retired gravel
walk, where the power of a call turns the current hour to one
bless indeed, and prepare it for all the immortality that the
happiest memories of their own future life.Over there
they exchanged those feelings and those promises that once were
previously everything seemed to be secure, but that had followed suit
many, many years of division and alienation.There they returned
again in the past, perhaps more wonderfully happy in them
reunification, then when it was first projected; more tender, more
tried, more fixated in knowledge of each other's character, truth and
attachment; more equal to act, more justified to act.And there, if
they walked slowly through the gradual ascent, disregarding every group around
those who see neither wandering politicians nor busy housekeepers,
flirtatious girls, neither nannies and children, they could indulge themselves
those retrospectives and acknowledgments, and especially in them
explanation of what immediately preceded the present moment, that
were so poignant and so incessantly interested.Everything small
variations from the past week have been reviewed; and from yesterday and
today could hardly come to an end.She hadn't mistaken him.Jealousy of Mr. Elliot had been the backlog
weight, the doubt, the torment.That had started to work in the very
hour of first meeting her in Bath; who had returned, after a short
suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him
everything he had said and done, or failed to say and do, in the last ...
twenty-four hours.It had gradually gotten better
hopes that occasionally encouraged her looks, words, or deeds; it
was finally overcome by those feelings and they show them
had reached him while talking to Captain Harville; and under the
irresistible governance from which he had confiscated a sheet of paper, and
poured out his feelings.Nothing he had written at the time was to be withdrawn or qualified.He insisted he had loved no one but her.She had never been there
repressed.He didn't even believe he would see her right away.So
much indeed he had to admit: that he had been constant
unconsciously, yes unintentionally; that he had wanted to forget her,
and believed it would happen.He had imagined himself indifferent, when
he had only been angry; and he had been unjust as to her merits, because ...
he had suffered.Her character was now fixated on his
the mind as perfection itself, the most beautiful medium of it
constancy and softness; but only that he had to admit
in Uppercross he had learned to do her justice, and only in Lyme had he…
began to understand himself.He had learned more from Lyme
than one kind.At least Mr. Elliot's passing admiration had aroused
him, and the scenes on the Cobb and with Captain Harville fixed her
superiority.In his earlier attempts to bond with Louisa Musgrove (de
attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had felt it forever
be impossible; that he couldn't have cared about Louisa;
but until that day, until the free time for reflection that followed
he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which
Louisa's could so ill bear comparison, or the perfect unparalleled grasp
it owned his.There he had learned to distinguish between
the constancy of the principle and the stubbornness of one's own will, between the
audacity of heedlessness and the determination of a calm mind.Over there
he had seen everything to glorify the woman he had
lost; and that's where the pride, the folly, the madness of ...
resentment, which kept him from trying to get her back when he was thrown in
are gone.From that time on, his fine had become severe.He had never been before
free from the horror and remorse that the first few days of
Louisa's accident, as soon as he started to feel alive again, or he
had come to feel, although he was alive, was not free.“I found out,” he said, “that I was considered a betrothed man by Harville!
That neither Harville nor his wife had any doubts about our mutual...
attachment.I was shocked and shocked.To a certain extent I could
contradict this immediately; but, when I started to reflect that others
might have felt the same - her own family, yes, maybe herself - I was
no longer available to me.I was hers in her honor if she so wished.I had been unguarded.I had not seriously considered this topic
before.I hadn't thought that my excessive intimacy had to have her
danger of adverse effects in many ways; and that I had no right
try to bond with one of the girls at the
risk of even making an unpleasant report, there were no other sick
Effects.I was grossly wrong and have to face the consequences."

In short, he discovered too late that he himself had become entangled; and that
just as he was completely satisfied that he didn't care about Louisa
everything, he should consider himself bound to her, as her feelings for him
were what the Harvilles supposed.It decided to leave him Lyme, and...
await her full recovery elsewhere.He would happily weaken
honest means, whatever feelings or speculations about him may be
to exist; and he therefore went to his brother, that is, after a while
to return to Kellynch, and act as circumstances require."I was with Edward for six weeks," he said, "and saw him happily....I can
have no other pleasure.I didn't earn anything.He asked for you a lot
in particular; asked, even if you have changed personally, little
Suspecting that in my eyes you could never change."

Anne smiled and let it pass.It was too pleasant a blunder for one
blame.It's something for a woman to be sure of, in her
twenty-eighth years, that she has not lost one charm from before
youth; but the value of such a tribute was unspeakably increased
Anne, by comparing it to previous words, and feeling that it is the
result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.He had stayed in Shropshire and complained of his own blindness
pride, and the blunders of his own calculations, until they were immediately released
from Louisa by the amazing and happy intelligence of her
involvement with Benwick.“Here,” he said, “the worst of my condition ended, for now at least I could ...
putting myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself; I could do
something.But to be inactive for so long, and just waiting
angry, had been terrible.Within the first five minutes I said, 'I will
Wednesday in Bath, 'and I was ....Was it unforgivable to think it?
worth coming? and to arrive with any hope? YOU
were single.You may have had the feelings of the
past, as I did; and one encouragement was mine.I can
never doubt that you would be loved and sought after by others, but I knew that
a certainty that you had refused at least one man or better
pretensions than myself; and I couldn't help but say, 'Was this?
for me?'"

Their first meeting on Milsom Street offered a lot to say, but the ...
concert even more.That night seemed to be exquisite
moments.The moment she steps forward into the Octagon Room
talk to him: the moment when Mr Elliot appears and tears her apart
away, and one or two subsequent moments, marked by recurring hope or
growing despondency, living with energy."To see you," he cried, "among those who are not my...
benefactors; to see your cousin close to you, talking and smiling,
and feel all the terrible qualities and properties of the match!
To take it as the sure wish of any being who could hope to
influence you! Even if your own feelings were restrained or
indifferent to think what powerful support he would have! Was it
not enough to fool me that I appeared? What could I look like?
without pain? Wasn't the sight of the friend behind it
you, were not the memory of what had been, the knowledge of her
influence, the indelible, unshakable impression of what conviction had
once done - wasn't it all against me? "

'You should have distinguished,' replied Anne."You shouldn't have
suspect me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.If I was wrong in ever giving in to persuasion, remember it was to
belief exercised on the side of safety, not risk.When I surrendered
I thought it was duty, but no duty could be invoked here.In
to marry a man who is indifferent to me would have taken every risk,
and all duty violated."

"Perhaps I should have reasoned thus," he replied, "but I could not....I could not take advantage of the belated knowledge I had gained about
your character.I couldn't bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,
buried, lost in those previous feelings that I had hurt under
year after year.I could only see you as someone who had caved, who
had given up on me, being influenced by someone instead of me.I saw you with the same person who led you that year from
misery.I had no reason to believe her of less authority now.The
habit force had to be added."

'I should have thought,' said Anne, 'that maybe my way of acting to yourself…
did you save all this or a lot."

'No no! Your demeanor may just be the ease with which you get engaged
another man would give.I have left you in this faith; and yet I was
determined to see you again.My courage gathered with the morning, and
I felt I still had a motive to stay here."

Finally Anne was back home, and happier than anyone else in that house
could have come up with.All the surprise and suspense, and all the others
painful part of the morning disappeared because of this conversation, she
re-entered the house so glad that in some they were obliged to find an alloy
temporary fear that it is impossible to keep it up.A break
of meditation, earnestly and gratefully, was the best corrective means of it
all that is dangerous in such high happiness; and she went to her
room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the gratitude of her
pleasure.It was evening, the salons were lit, the company
assembled.It was just a card party, it was just a mix of those who
had never met before, and those who met too often; an everyday
cases, too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne
never found an evening shorter.Glowing and beautiful in sensitivity
and happiness, and more widely admired than she thought of whether
cared for, she had happy or tolerant feelings for every being
around her.Mr. Elliot was there; she avoided it, but she could feel sorry for him.The Wallises, she enjoyed understanding them.Lady Dalrymple
and Miss Carteret - they would soon be innocent cousins ​​of hers.They
didn't care for Mrs. Clay, and had nothing to blush about in public
manners of her father and sister.With the Musgroves there was the
happy chat with perfect ease; with Captain Harville, the good-hearted one
brother and sister community; with Lady Russell, attempts to
conversation, which broke off a glorious consciousness; with admiral
and Mrs Croft, all of special cordiality and fervent interest,
who tried to hide the same consciousness; and with captain
Wentworth, some moments of communication that take place all the time, and
always hoping for more, and always knowing it was there.It was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied
admiring a beautiful display of greenhouse plants, that's what she said...

"I've been thinking about the past and trying to be impartial about...
the right and wrong, I mean in reference to myself; and i have to believe
that I was right, no matter how much it bothered me, that I was perfect
precisely by being guided by the friend you will love more than you
do it now.For me she was in the place of a parent.don't confuse me,
however.I'm not saying she wasn't mistaken in her advice.It was,
perhaps one of those cases where advice is only good or bad if the
event decides; and for myself I should certainly never do that, by no means
circumstance of acceptable similarity, give such advice.But I mean,
that I was right in submitting to her, and that if I had
otherwise I would have had to suffer more to continue the engagement
than I even did by giving up, 'cause I should have suffered in my ...
conscience.I have now, as far as such sentiment is permissible in
human nature, nothing to blame myself; and if I'm not mistaken, a
a strong sense of duty is not a bad part of a woman's part."

He looked at her, looked at Lady Russell, and looked at her again,
replied, as if in cool deliberation--

"Not yet.But there is hope that she will be forgiven in time.I trust
to have with her charity soon.But I've also thought about it
the past, and a question has arisen, or maybe not there?
has one person been my enemy more than that lady? my own me.Tell me if, when I returned to England in the year eight, with a few
thousand pounds, and was placed in the Laconia, if I had then written
to you, would you have answered my letter? In short, would you
then the engagement renewed?"

"Would I!" was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough."Good God!" he cried, "you would! It's not that I didn't think about it"
it, or long for it, as what alone could crown all my other success; but I
was proud, too proud to ask again.I did not understand you.I close
my eyes, and would not understand you or do you justice.This is a
reminder that everyone should forgive me sooner than...
myself.Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared.It's also a kind of pain that's new to me.I am used to the
satisfaction to believe that I have earned every blessing that I
enjoyed.I have valued myself for honorable toil and just rewards.Like other great men under setbacks, ”he added with a smile."I have to
try to submit my mind to my fortune.I must learn to bear it
happier than I deserve."



Chapter 24


Who can doubt what followed? When two young people take
having it in their head to get married, they are pretty sure through persistence to
wear their point, whether they be so poor, or ever so careless, or ever
so little probably needed for each other's ultimate comfort.This may be a bad moral to end on, but I think it is
truth; and if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and ...
an Anne Elliot, with the benefit of maturity of mind, consciousness
of right, and an independent fortune between them, failing to bear
any opposition down? They would, in fact, be a great one
deal with more than they met, for there was little to torment them
beyond the lack of courtesy and warmth.Sir Walter said no
objected, and Elizabeth did nothing worse than looking cold and ...
carefree.Captain Wentworth, with twenty-five thousand pounds,
and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him,
was no longer nobody.He was now considered very worthy of the
daughter of a foolish, wasteful baron who had no principles
or wise enough to cope with the situation in which
Providence had placed him, and now his daughter could give it
but a small part of the ten thousand pound share that must be hers...
after this.Sir Walter, indeed, though he had no affection for Anne, and no vanity ...
flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion, was far from it
thinking it was a bad match for her.On the contrary, when he saw more of it
Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly in daylight, and looked him closely,
he was very moved by his personal claims and felt his own
superiority of appearance could not be unfairly weighed against her
superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by his good-sounding name,
finally enabled Sir Walter to prepare his pen with very good grace,
for the inclusion of the marriage in the honor roll.The only one among them whose opposition of feeling could arouse anyone ...
Lady Russell was of serious concern.Anne knew Lady Russell had to be
suffer some pain in understanding and giving up on Mr. Elliot, and
make the effort to really get to know, and do
justice to Captain Wentworth.However, this was what Lady Russell had
to do now.She had to learn to feel that she was mistaken
with regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced by performances in
each; because Captain Wentworth's manners don't suit her
ideas, she had suspected too soon for one
character of dangerous impetuousness; and that's because Mr. Elliot's
manners had pleased her in their decency and correctness,
their general politeness and kindness, had she been in too soon
they receive as the sure result of the most correct opinions and
well-regulated mind.Lady Russell could do nothing else,
then admit she was completely wrong, and record
a new set of opinions and hope.With some there is a speed of perception, a niceness in the discernment
of character, a natural penetration, in short, in which there is no experience
others can match, and Lady Russell was less gifted in this part of
understanding than her young friend.But she was a very good woman
and if her second aim were sensible and deliberate, her first...
was to see Anne happy.She loved Anne more than she loved her
capabilities; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over, found
little effort to bond as a mother to the man it was
securing the happiness of her other child.Of all the family, Mary was probably the one who was most immediately satisfied
by the circumstance.It was creditable to have a sister married, and
she might flatter herself that she played a big part in the…
connection, by keeping Anne with her in the fall; and as her own
sister must be better than her husband sisters it was very pleasant
that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than both captains
Benwick or Charles Hayter.She was suffering something, maybe when ...
they got back in touch when they saw how Anne regained the rights of
seniority, and the mistress of a very beautiful landaulette; but she had a
future to look forward to, of powerful comfort.Anne didn't have any
Uppercross Hall to her, no land holdings, no head of family authority;
and if only they could prevent Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet,
she wouldn't change the situation with Anne.It would be good for the eldest sister to be equally satisfied
with her situation, for a change is not very likely there.She had
soon Mr. Elliot's death receded, and none of it
good condition has since presented itself to even the
unfounded hopes that sunk with him.The news of his niece Anne's engagement hit Mr Elliot the most
unexpected.It messed up his best plan of domestic happiness, his
best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the vigilance a
would have given the rights of son-in-law.But, although dissatisfied and
disappointed, he was still able to do something for his own sake and his
own pleasure.He soon left Bath; and that Mrs Clay quits
shortly afterwards, and next time heard from as determined under his
protection in London, it was obvious how double he had been
play, and how determined he was to keep him from falling out
at least by one cunning woman.Mrs. Clay's affection had overwhelmed her interest, and she had...
sacrificed, for the sake of the young man, the ability to make plans
longer for Sir Walter.However, she also has abilities
affection; and it is now a questionable point whether his cunning, whether
of her, can finally bear the day; or, after preventing her,
Because he is Sir Walter's wife, he should not be praised and caressed
last in making her the wife of Sir William.There is no doubt that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and...
mortified by the loss of their companion and the discovery of their
deception in her.They certainly had their great cousins ​​to take refuge
to for comfort; but they must feel long to flatter and follow
others, without being flattered and followed in turn, are but a state of
half fun.Anne, pleased at a very early stage of Lady Russell's intent to...
love captain Wentworth the way she should, had no other alloy but the
happiness of her prospects than what sprang from the consciousness of
have no relations to bestow upon him that a sensible man could appreciate.There she felt her own inferiority very sharply.The disproportionality in
their fortune was nothing; it didn't regret her for a moment; but
to have no family to receive and treasure him well, none of it
respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer in return for all
worth it and all the quick welcome that met her in his brothers and
sisters, was a source of pain as vivid as her mind could be
wisely or under circumstances of otherwise strong luck.She had
only two friends in the world to add to his list, Lady Russell and Mrs.
Smith.However, he was very inclined to bond with them.Lady Russell, for all her past transgressions, he could now...
value from his heart.Although he was under no obligation to say that he believed ...
that she had been right in dividing them originally, he was willing to say
almost everything else in her favor, and as for Mrs. Smith, she had it
different types of claims to recommend her quickly and permanently.Her recent good services by Anne had been enough in itself, and
their marriage, instead of robbing her of one friend, secured her
two.She was their first visitor in their regular lives; and captain
Wentworth, by standing in the way of her restoring her husband's
property in the West Indies, by writing for her, acting for her and
her through all the little difficulties of the case with the
activity and effort of a fearless man and a determined friend, completely
pay back the services it had rendered or ever wanted to render,
to his wife.Mrs. Smith's joys were not spoiled by this improvement in income,
with some improvement in health, and the acquisition of such friends
often be present, for her cheerfulness and enthusiasm did not fail
her; and while these primary supplies remained well, they might still have ...
resist even greater accessions of worldly prosperity.They
may have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy, and yet be
happy.Her spring of happiness was in the glow of her mind, like her
friend Anne's was in the warmth of her heart.Anne was tenderness
herself, and she had its full value in Captain Wentworth's
affection.His profession was the only thing that could ever make her friends
wish less tenderness, the fear of a future war that could diminish everything
her sunshine.She enjoyed being a sailor wife, but she has to pay
the load of quick alarm for belonging to that profession that is, if
possible, more distinguished in his domestic virtues than in his
National importance.Finis

Section 4.Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends on and cannot survive without broad
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that may be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible to the widest
range of equipment, including obsolete equipment.Lots of small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to keep tax-free
status with the IRS.The Foundation is committed to complying with regulatory laws
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States
States.Compliance requirements are not uniform and there is a
a lot of effort, a lot of paperwork and a lot of fees to meet and keep track of each other
with these requirements.We do not ask for donations at locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
special state visit https: // pglaf.org

Although we cannot and do not want to ask for contributions from states where we do so
have not met the recruitment requirements, we know of no ban
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states
approach us with offers to donate.International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make them
any statements about the tax treatment of gifts received from received
outside the United States.YOU.so.only laws flood our little staff.Check Project Gutenberg's webpages for current donations
methods and addresses.Donations are accepted in a number of others
ways, including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.To donate, go to: https: // pglaf.org / donate

to work.Professor Michael S.Hart was the initiator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that can be freely shared
with someone.For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with just a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from multiple printed
editions, all of which have been confirmed as Public Domain in the U.so.unless a copyright notice is included.So we don't necessarily have to
store eBooks in accordance with a particular paper edition.Most people start on our website which has the main PG search feature:
