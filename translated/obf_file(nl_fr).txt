Chapter 1


Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, Somersetshire, was a man who,
for his own amusement, never picked up any other book than the Baronnage; the
he found an occupation for an idle hour, and a consolation in a
a; there his faculties were aroused in admiration and respect, by
consider the limited remainder of the early patents; there are some
unwanted feelings, arising from domestic affairs, naturally changed
in pity and contempt as he turned the nearly endless creations
of the last century; and there, if all the other leaves were powerless, he
could read his own story with an interest that never failed.This
was the page the favorite volume always opened to:

           "ELLIOT DE KELLYNCH SALLE."Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married July 15, 1784 to Elizabeth,
daughter of James Stevenson, Esq.of South Park, in the county of
Gloucester, by which lady (d.1800) he fathered Elizabeth, née
June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a stillborn son, November 5
1789; Marie, born November 20, 1791."

This is precisely how the paragraph originally stood from the printer
hands; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of
himself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary's birth--
"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove,
Esq.of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset ”, and inserting most
exactly the day of the month he lost his wife.Then followed the history and rise of the old and respectable
family, in the usual terms; how it was first settled in Cheshire;
as mentioned in Dugdale, serving the high sheriff's office,
representative of a district in three successive legislatures, the efforts of
loyalty and dignity of baronet, the first year of Charles II, with
all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married; forming a total of two
beautiful duodecimo pages, and ending with the arms and
motto: - "Headquarters, Kellynch Hall, in the county of Somerset," and
Sir Walter's writing again in this finale: -

"Heir apparent, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great-grandson of
second Sir Walter."

Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character;
vanity of person and situation.He had been remarkably handsome in
her youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very handsome man.Few women
could think more about their personal appearance than him, and neither could
the valet of all new lord rejoices more in the place he occupied
in society.He considered the blessing of beauty to be inferior only to
the blessing of a barony; and Sir Walter Elliot, who united
these gifts, has been the constant object of his warmest respect and
devotion.Her beauty and her rank had a just right over her attachment; since
to them he must have a woman of character far superior to all
something deserved by his people.Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,
sensitive and kind; whose judgment and conduct, if they could be
forgave the youthful infatuation that made her Lady Elliot, never had
the indulgence required after.--She had fun, or softened, or
hid his failures and promoted his real respectability for
seventeen years; and although he is not the happiest being in the world
herself, had found enough in her homework, her friends and her children,
to attach it to life, and that it is not indifferent to him
when she was called to leave them.- Three daughters, the two eldest
sixteen and fourteen years old, was a terrible legacy for a mother to bequeath, a
rather terrible burden, to confide in the authority and direction of a
conceited and foolish father.She had, however, a very close friend, a
sane and deserving woman, who had been brought, by a strong attachment
to herself, to settle near her, in the village of Kellynch; and on
her kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied on the best help
and maintaining the good principles and education she had
been anxiously giving her daughters.This friend, and Sir Walter, did not get married no matter what.
anticipated on this head by their knowledge.Thirteen years old were
deceased since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still close to
neighbors and close friends, and one remained a widower, the other
a widow.This Lady Russell, of stable age and character, and extremely well
planned, shouldn't think about a second marriage, don't need
apologies to the public, which is rather likely to be unreasonably
unhappy when a woman marries again, than when she does not marry; But
Sir Walter's pursuit of celibacy requires explanation.Whether it be
knew then that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met a
or two private deceptions in very unreasonable applications),
boasted of staying celibate for the sake of his dear daughters.For
a girl, his eldest, he would have really abandoned everything,
what he hadn't been very tempted to do.Elizabeth had
succeeded, at the age of sixteen, to all that was possible, of the rights of his mother
and consequence; and being very beautiful and very similar to him, she
influence had always been great, and they had evolved the most together
Fortunately.Her other two children were of much lower value.Marie had
acquired some artificial importance, by becoming Mrs. Charles
Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and a gentleness of
character, who must have placed her high among all the people of
understanding, no one was with his father or sister; his word did not have
weight, her convenience was always to give in - she was only Anne.For Lady Russell, indeed, she was a very dear and much appreciated person.
goddaughter, favorite and friend.Lady Russell loved them all; But
it was only in Anne that she could imagine that the mother resuscitates.A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her
the flowering had disappeared prematurely; and as even in his height, his father had
found little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicate
soft dark features and eyes of its own), there could be nothing in
them, now that she was faded and thin, to excite her esteem.He had
never gave much hope, he had none now, never to read his name in
any other page of his favorite work.Any equality of alliance must
rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had simply bonded with an old
family of countries of respectability and great fortune, and therefore had
given all the honor and received none: Elizabeth would, someday or
other, get married properly.Sometimes a woman is more beautiful at twenty-nine than she
was ten years ago; and, in general, if there has been
neither disease nor anxiety, it is a period of life when hardly
all charm is lost.It was so with Elizabeth, still the same beautiful
Miss Elliot, whom she began to have thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter
could therefore apologize for forgetting his age, or, at least, be
considered a half-fool, to believe himself and Elizabeth as fulfilled
as always, amid the wreckage of everyone's beauty; For him
could clearly see the ages of everyone else in his family and acquaintance
were growing up.Anne haggard, Mary rude, every face in the
neighborhood aggression and rapid increase in crow's feet
Lady Russell's temples had long been a distress to him.Elizabeth hasn't quite matched her father in personal contentment.Thirteen years had seen his mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and
lead with self-control and a decision that never could have
given the idea that she is younger than she was.For thirteen years
if she had done the honors and laid down the right
home, and clearing the way for the chair and the four, and walking
immediately after Lady Russell out of all salons and
dining rooms in the countryside.The rotating frosts of thirteen winters had
saw her open every ball of credit a rare quarter
offered, and thirteen springs displayed their flowers, as she traveled
in London with his father, for a few weeks of annual enjoyment of the
big world.She had the memory of it all, she had the
awareness of being nine and twenty years old to give him some regrets and
some apprehensions; she was fully satisfied to be still so
more beautiful than ever, but she felt his years approaching danger, and
would have been happy to be certain to be correctly requested by
baronet blood in the next twelve or two months.So could she still
take up the book again with as much pleasure as in his early youth,
but now she didn't like it.Always to present with its date
her own birth and see no marriage follow other than that of a younger sister,
makes the book an evil; and more than once, when his father had left him
open on the table next to her, had she closed it, her eyes looked away, and
repulsed.She had had a disappointment, moreover, that this book, and above all
the history of his own family, must always present the memory of.The heir apparent, the very William Walter Elliot, Esq., whose
rights had been so generously supported by his father, had disappointed
her.She had, when she was a very young girl, as soon as she knew he was,
in case she had no brother, the future baronet wanted
marry her, and her father had always meant that she should.He had not
been known to them as a boy; but shortly after Lady Elliot's death, Sir
Walter had sought knowledge, and although his overtures did not
received with some warmth, he had persevered in the search, making
allowance for the modest decline of youth; and, in one of their
Spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom, Mr.
Elliot had been forced into the introduction.He was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of
law; and Elizabeth found it extremely pleasant, and every shot of her
favor has been confirmed.He was invited to Kellynch Hall; it was spoken
from and expected the rest of the year; but he never came.the
the following spring, he was seen again in town, just as pleasant,
again encouraged, invited and waited, and again he did not come; and
the next news was he was married.Instead of pushing her
fortune in the line traced for the heir to the house of Elliot, he
had bought independence by uniting with a wealthy woman of
lower birth.Sir Walter was offended.As head of the house, he felt that he
should have been consulted, especially after taking the young man
publicly by the hand; "Because they must have been seen together," he
observed, "once at Tattersall, and twice in the lobby of the House of
Communal room."His disapproval was expressed, but apparently very little
considered.Mr. Elliot had made no apologies and had shown himself
careless of being more noticed by the family, like Sir Walter
considered him unworthy of this: all knowledge between them had
ceased.This very awkward story of Mr. Elliot was again, after an interval of
years, angered by Elizabeth, who had loved the man for
himself, and even more to be the heir of his father, and whose strong
family pride could only see in him a suitable match for Sir Walter
Elliot's eldest daughter.There wasn't a baronet from A to Z with whom she
feelings could so gladly have been recognized as equal.And yet
miserably he had behaved, that although she was at that moment
time (summer 1814) wearing black ribbons for his wife, she could
don't admit it is worth thinking about it again.The shame of his first
maybe marriage could, because there was no reason to suppose so
perpetuated by offspring, were overcome, if he had not done worse;
but he had, as with the usual intervention of good friends,
had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of all, most
with contempt and contempt for the very blood to which he belonged, and
the honors that were to be his from now on.It couldn't be
forgiven.Such were the feelings and sensations of Elizabeth Elliot; such worries
to combine, the agitations to vary, the similarity and the elegance, the
the prosperity and the nothingness of its scene of life; such feelings
to give interest to a long and uneventful residence in a circle of countries,
to fill vacancies that there were no utility habits abroad, no
talents or achievements for the home, to occupy.But now another occupation and solicitude of mind began to be
added to these.Her father was increasingly in distress for the money.It
knew that when he took over the Baronetage, it was to lead the
the heavy bills of his traders and the unwelcome allusions of Mr.
Shepherd, his agent, of his thoughts.The Kellynch property was
good, but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the required state
in its owner.While Lady Elliot lived there had been a method,
the moderation and economy which had just kept him in his income; But
with her had died so much common sense, and from this period he
had constantly passed him.It had not been possible for him to
spend less; he had done nothing other than what Sir Walter Elliot was
imperiously called to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only
more and more in debt, but heard about it so often that he
has become futile to try to hide it any longer, even partially, from its
the girl.He had given her some clues last spring in town;
he even went so far as to say: "Can we withdraw?
you that there is an article in which we can reduce? "and
Elizabeth, to do him justice, had, in the first ardor of the feminine alarm,
seriously thinking about what could be done, and had finally proposed
these two branches of the economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities,
and to refrain from rearranging the living room; to which
expedients, she then added the happy thought of not taking
present to Anne, as was the annual custom.But these
the measurements, so good in themselves, were insufficient for the real
the extent of the evil, to which Sir Walter found himself obliged
confess to him shortly after.Elizabeth had nothing to offer
deeper efficiency.She felt misused and unhappy just like her
dad; and neither of them were able to imagine a way to
reduce their expenses without compromising their dignity, or
give up their comfort so as not to be endured.There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of
of; but if every acre had been alienable it wouldn't have made
difference.He had deigned to mortgage as much as he had the
power, but he would never deign to sell.No; he would never be
dishonor his name so far.Kellynch domain must be passed
whole and whole, as he had received it.Their two confidential friends, Mr. Shepherd, who lived in the
the neighboring town and Lady Russell were called in to advise them;
and the father and daughter seemed to expect something to be
struck off by one or the other to remove their embarrassment and
reduce their expenses, without losing any indulgence
of taste or pride.Chapter 2


Mr. Shepherd, civil and prudent lawyer, who, whatever his position
or his opinions on Sir Walter, would rather than the disagreeable
by someone else, apologized for giving the slightest hint, and
only asked permission to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent
judgment of Lady Russell, whose common sense he
expected to be advised the resolute actions he intended to see
finally adopted.Lady Russell was very anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it
very serious consideration.She was a woman rather sonorous than
rapid abilities, including difficulties in making a decision in this
the instance was great, from the opposition of two guiding principles.She herself was of strict integrity, with a delicate sense of honor;
but she was also eager to save Sir Walter's feelings,
for the credit of the family, because aristocratic in his ideas of what was
thanks to them, as any sane and honest person could be.She was a
benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of strong attachments,
most correct in its conduct, strict in its notions of decorum, and with
manners that were considered a standard of good breeding.She had a
cultivated mind, and was, in general, rational and coherent;
but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry; she was valuable to
the rank and the consequence, which blinded him a little to the faults of these
who owned them.Herself widow of a single knight, she gave the
dignity of a baronet in its due course; and Sir Walter, independent of his
claims to be an old acquaintance, a careful neighbor, a
owner, the husband of her dear friend, Anne's father and
his sisters, was, like Sir Walter, in his apprehension, entitled to
a lot of compassion and consideration under his present
difficulties.They must take refuge; who admitted no doubt.But she was very
eager to do so with as little pain as possible for him and
Elisabeth.She drew up savings plans, she made exact calculations,
and she did what no one else thought she was doing: she consulted Anne, who
never seemed viewed by others as having an interest in the
question.She consulted and, to some extent, was influenced by it in
staking out the redundancy plan which was finally submitted to
Sir Walter.Every Anne amendment had been on the side of honesty
against the importance.She wanted more vigorous measures, a
reform, faster debt relief, a much higher tone of
indifference to everything except justice and fairness."If we can persuade your father of all this," said Lady Russell, "
looking at his paper, "a lot can be done.If he will adopt them
regulations, in seven years it will be clear; and i hope we can
to convince him and Elizabeth that Kellynch Hall has a respectability
in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions; and that the
the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be far from being diminished in the
the eyes of sane people, acting like a man of principle.What will be
it does, in fact, but what many of our early families have
done, or should be done? There will be nothing unusual in his case; and
it is the singularity that often makes the worst of our suffering, as
it always does our driving.I have high hopes of winning.We
must be serious and determined; because after all, the person who has
the debts contracted must pay them; and although this is largely due to the
feelings of the gentleman and the head of the house, like your father,
there is still more because of the character of an honest man."

This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be
proceed, his friends to urge him.She considered it an act
the essential duty to liquidate the claims of creditors with all
the expedition that the most complete entrenchments could provide,
and I saw no dignity in anything less.She wanted it to be
prescribed and felt as a duty.She assessed Lady Russell's influence
very; and as to the severe degree of self-denial
conscience prompted, she believed that there might be little more difficulty
by persuading them of a complete, than of a half-reform.Her
the knowledge of her father and Elizabeth led her to think that the
the sacrifice of a pair of horses would be hardly less painful than
at once, and so on, through the whole list of Lady Russell's Too Sweet
reductions.How Anne's more rigid requisitions could have been taken
result.Lady Russell had no success: could not be put together
with, should not be supported.“What! all the comforts of life have been destroyed!
Travels, London, servants, horses, table - contractions and
restrictions everywhere! No longer live with the decency even of
a private gentleman! No, he would rather leave Kellynch Hall right away,
than to stay there under such shameful conditions."

“Leave Kellynch Hall."The allusion was immediately taken up by Mr.
Shepherd, whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter's life
entrenchment, and who was perfectly convinced that nothing would be done
without change of domicile.“Since the idea was born in the
same neighborhood that was to dictate, he had no qualms, he said, in
admit that his judgment is entirely on this side.He does not have
seem to him that Sir Walter could materially modify his style of
living in a house that had such a character of hospitality and antiquity
dignity to support.In any other place that Sir Walter could judge for
himself; and would be considered to regulate lifestyles in
however he might choose to model his house."

Sir Walter would be leaving Kellynch Hall; and after a few more days
doubt and indecision, the big question of where he should go was
settled, and the first glimpse of this important change is.There had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house in
the country.All Anne's wishes had been for the latter.A little house
in their own neighborhood, where they could still have Lady Russell's
society, to always be close to Mary, and still have the pleasure of sometimes
see the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the subject of his
ambition.But Anne's usual fate accompanied her, having something
very opposed to his inclination fixed on.She didn't like Bath and
didn't think he agreed with her; and Bath was to be his home.Sir Walter had thought more of London at first; but Mr. Shepherd felt
that he could not be trusted in London and that he had been skilled enough to
dissuade him from this, and make Bath favorite.It was much safer
place for a gentleman in his predicament: there might be
relatively inexpensively.Two material advantages of Bath over
London had of course had its full weight: it's more practical
distance from Kellynch, just fifty miles, and Lady Russell's expenses
part of every winter there; and to the great satisfaction of
Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been for
Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were led to believe that they should
lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.Lady Russell felt compelled to oppose the known wishes of her dear Anne.He
it would be too much to expect Sir Walter to stay in a little house in
his own neighborhood.Anne herself reportedly found the
mortifications of it more than she had foreseen, and to Sir Walter
feelings they must have been terrible.And with regard to Anne
aversion to Bath, she regarded it as a prejudice and an error occurring,
first, from the fact that she was three years in school
there, after the death of his mother; and secondly, because it happens to be
not in a very good mood the only winter she had after
spent there with herself.Lady Russell loved Bath, in short, and was inclined to think that it was necessary
suitable for all; and as for the health of her young friend, passing all the
warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge, all danger would be avoided;
and it was in fact, a change that must do both the health and the mind
good.Anne had been too little home, too little seen.His minds
were not high.A larger society would improve them.She wanted her to do it
to be better known.The unwanted character of any other house in the same neighborhood for
Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by a part, and a very
material part of the project, which fortunately had been grafted onto the
start.He was not only to leave his house, but to see him in the
the hands of others; a test of courage, only heads stronger than sir
Walter found too many.Kellynch Hall was to be rented.This,
however, was a deep secret, not to breathe beyond their own
circle.Sir Walter could not have endured the degradation of being known to
design leaving his house.Mr. Shepherd had already mentioned the word
"to advertise", but I never dared to approach it again.Sir Walter rejected the
idea of ​​his offer in any way; forbids the slightest clue
to be abandoned to have such an intention; and it was only the
supposition that it is spontaneously solicited by some
blameless seeker, on his own terms, and as a great favor,
that he would leave it at all.How quickly the reasons come to approve what we like! Lady Russell
had another excellent on hand, to be extremely happy that Sir
Walter and his family had to leave the country.Elizabeth had
recently formed an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.It was with Mr. Shepherd's daughter, who had returned, after a
unsuccessful marriage, at her father's house, with in addition
burden of two children.She was an intelligent young woman, who understood
the art of pleasing - the art of pleasing, at least, in Kellynch Hall;
and who had made Miss Elliot so pleasant, that she had been
already staying there more than once, despite everything Lady
Russell, who thought it was a totally inappropriate friendship, might be hinting at
prudence and reserve.Lady Russell, indeed, had virtually no influence over Elizabeth, and
seemed to love him, rather because she would love him, than because
Elizabeth deserved it.She had never received from her more than
external attention, nothing beyond the observances of complacency; had
never succeeded in any point that she wanted to wear, against
previous tilt.She had repeatedly been very serious in trying
to include Anne in the reasonably open tour of London
injustice and all the discrediting of the selfish arrangements that closed
her exit, and on many lesser occasions had endeavored to give Elizabeth
the benefit of own judgment and experience; but still in
vain: Elizabeth would follow her own path; and she had never pursued him in
more pronounced opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs.
Clay; to turn away from the society of such a deserving sister, to give her
affection and trust in someone who shouldn't have meant nothing to him
but the object of a distant civility.Of the situation, Mrs. Clay was, in Lady Russell's estimation, a very
unequal, and in his character she believed a very dangerous companion;
and a move that would leave Mrs. Clay behind, and bring a choice of
intimate friends more appropriate to Miss Elliot's reach, was therefore a
object of primary importance.chapter 3


"I must take leave of watching, Sir Walter," said Mr. Shepherd an
morning at Kellynch Hall, as he put down the newspaper, "may the
the current situation is in our favor.This peace will turn everything
our rich naval officers ashore.They will all want a home.The timing could not be better, Sir Walter, to have a choice of tenants,
very responsible tenants.Much of a noble fortune was made during
the war.If a wealthy admiral came in our way, Sir Walter ... "

"He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd," replied Sir Walter; "this is
all i have to notice.A prize would indeed be for him Kellynch Hall;
rather the greatest prize of all, that he took so many
before; Hey, shepherd? "

Mr. Shepherd laughed, as he knew, at that wit, then added:

"I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that in the course of business,
the gentlemen of the navy are treated well.I had a little
knowledge of their working methods; and I am free to confess
that they have very liberal notions, and are also likely to do
desirable tenants like any group of people to meet.Therefore, Sir Walter, what I would like to say is that if
following rumors circulating about your intention; which
must be seen as a possible thing, because we know how much
it is to keep the actions and conceptions of a part of the world of the
the attention and curiosity of the other; the consequence has its tax; Me, John
Shepherd, could hide all the family things I chose, for no one
would think it was worth watching me; but Sir Walter Elliot
has eyes on him that can be very difficult to escape; and
therefore, I dare so much to venture that it will not surprise many
me if, with all our caution, a rumor of the truth should
abroad; in the hypothesis of which, as I was going to see, since
apps will follow without a doubt, I should think that one of our
wealthy naval commanders particularly deserve to be taken care of; and beg leave
to add, that two hours will bring me at any time, to spare you the
difficulty in answering."

Sir Walter just nodded.But soon after, getting up and pacing the
room, he observed sarcastically--

"There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would like to
don't be surprised to find yourself in a house of this description."

"They would look around, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,"
Mrs. Clay said, for Mrs. Clay was present: her father had driven her
finished, nothing being more useful to Mrs. Clay's health than a
Kellynch: "but I agree enough with my father to think that a sailor could
be a very desirable tenant.I have known a good part of
profession; and in addition to their liberality, they are so groomed and neat
in all their ways! Those precious photos that you have, Sir Walter, though
you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.Everything in and
about the house would be taken so excellent care! The gardens and
shrubs would be kept in almost as high order as they are now.You
Have no fear, Miss Elliot, that your own flower gardens
neglected."

`` As for all that, '' said Sir Walter coldly, supposing that I was induced.
to rent my house, I have in no way made my decision about the
privileges to be attached to it.I am not particularly inclined to
favor a tenant.The park would be open to him of course, and few navies
officers, or men of any other description, may have had such reach;
but what restrictions I could impose on the use of
land of pleasure, that's another thing.I don't like the idea of ​​my
the shrubs being always accessible; and I should recommend Miss
Elliot on his guard vis-à-vis his flower garden.I am very
unwilling to grant a tenant in Kellynch Hall any
favor, I assure you, whether he is a sailor or a soldier."

After a short pause, Mr. Shepherd pretended to say ...

“In all of these cases, there are established customs that make everything
simple and easy between owner and tenant.Your interest, Sir Walter,
is in good hands.Count on me to make sure that no tenant
has more than its just rights.I dare say that Sir Walter
Elliot can't be half as jealous of his own as John Shepherd will be
for him."

Here Anne spoke ...

"The navy, I think, which has done so much for us, has at least one
equal claim with any other group of men, for all the comforts and
privileges that any house can give.Sailors work hard enough for their
comfort, we must all allow."

"Very true, very true.What Miss Anne says is very true, ”was Mr.
Shepherd's line, and “Oh! Certainly ”was his daughter; but Sir
Walter's remark was, shortly after--

"The profession has its uses, but I should be sorry to see
friend of mine who is part of it."

"Indeed!" was the answer, and with an air of surprise."Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong reasons for
to oppose it.First, as the means of bringing people from
obscure birth in undue distinction, and elevating men to honors which
their fathers and grandfathers never dreamed; and secondly, as he
cuts the youth and vigor of a man most horribly; a sailor is aging
earlier than any other man.I watched him all my life.A man is
greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of a
of which the father, his father could have disdained to speak, and of
prematurely become an object of disgust itself, than in any other
line.One day last spring, in town, I was in the company of two men,
striking examples of what I'm talking about; Lord St Ives, whose father
we all know to have been a country priest, without bread to eat; I was
to make way for Lord St Ives, and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most
deplorable looking character, you can imagine; his face has the color of
mahogany, rough and rough to the last degree; all fine lines and wrinkles,
nine gray hairs on one side, and nothing but a drop of powder at the top.'In
the name of heaven, who is this old man? I say to one of my friends
who stood near, (Sir Basil Morley).'Old man!' cried sir
Basil, 'it's Admiral Baldwin.How old do you take for him?
"Sixty," I say, or maybe sixty-two.`` Forty, '' replied Sir Basil, ``
'forty, and no more.“Imagine my astonishment; I should not
easily forget Admiral Baldwin.I have never seen such a miserable
example of what a sailor's life can do; but to some extent I know it is
the same for all of them: they are all hit and exposed to
all climates and all weather, until they are not worth seeing.He
Too bad they weren't hit on the head right away, before they reached
Admiral Baldwin's age."

“No, Sir Walter,” cried Mrs. Clay, “it's really serious.To have
a little pity for the poor.We weren't all born to be beautiful.The sea is certainly not beautifying; sailors age well; I
to have observed it; they soon lose their youthful air.But then, isn't it
the same goes with many other professions, maybe most of the others? Soldiers,
in active service, are not at all better off: and even in the quietest
professions, there is labor and labor of the mind, if not
body, which rarely leaves the appearance of a man to the natural effect of time.The lawyer comes forward, rather cautious; the doctor is up at all hours,
and travel in all weather; and even the clergyman-- "she stopped a
time to think about what could be done for the pastor; - "and even the
clergyman, you know he has to go to infected rooms and expose
his health and look at all the injuries of a toxic atmosphere.In
done, as I have long been convinced, although every profession is
necessary and honorable in turn, it is only the fate of those who
are not obliged to follow any, who can live on a regular basis, in the
countries, choosing their own hours, following their own activities, and
live on their own property, without the torment of trying for more;
it is only their lot, I say, to hold the blessings of health and good
appearance in the extreme: I don't know of any other group of men than to lose
something of their personality when they stop being young enough."

It seemed that Mr. Shepherd, in this worry of speaking of Sir Walter
goodwill towards a naval officer as a tenant, had been gifted with
foresight; because the very first home application was a
Admiral Croft, with whom he soon came to be in company
attend quarterly sessions in Taunton; and indeed, he had received
a hint of the admiral from a London correspondent.By the ratio that
he rushed to Kellynch to do, Admiral Croft was from
Somersetshire, who had acquired a very good fortune, wished
to settle in his country and had come down to Taunton to
look at some places advertised in this immediate vicinity, which,
however, did not suit him; who accidentally heard - (it was just as
he predicted, Mr. Shepherd observed, that Sir Walter's preoccupations could not
be kept secret,) - accidentally hearing the possibility of
Kellynch Hall being for rent and including his (Mr. Shepherd's)
link with the owner, he had introduced himself to him in order to
do special research, and had, over a fairly long
conference, expressed a fondness for the place as strong as a man
who knew it only by description could smell; and given to Mr. Shepherd, in
his explicit account of himself, every proof of his being
responsible and eligible tenant."And who is Admiral Croft?" was Sir Walter's cold suspicious investigation.Mr. Shepherd replied that he belonged to a gentleman's family, and
mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little break that followed,
added--

"He's a white rear admiral.He was in the action of Trafalgar,
and has been in the East Indies ever since; he was stationed there, i
believe, several years."

"So I take it for granted," observed Sir Walter, "that his face is
about as orange as the cuffs and capes in my livery."

Mr. Shepherd hastened to assure him that Admiral Croft was a very vigorous,
generous man, handsome, a little beaten by the weather, certainly, but not
very much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and demeanor; do not
likely to make the slightest difficulty on the terms, wanted only one
comfortable house and enter it as soon as possible; knew he had to
pay for its convenience; knew what to rent a house fully furnished with this
consequence might fetch; shouldn't have been surprised if Sir Walter
had asked for more; had inquired about the mansion; would be happy to
the deputation, of course, but did not pay much attention to it; he said sometimes
drew a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.Mr. Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; highlighting all
the circumstances of the admiral's family, which made him particularly
desirable as a tenant.He was a married man with no children; the
very good condition.A house has never been well maintained, Mr.
Shepherd watched, without a lady: he did not know whether the furniture
might not be in danger of suffering so much where there was no lady, as
where there were a lot of children.A lady, without a family, was the very
best furniture curator in the world.He had seen Mrs. Croft too;
she was at Taunton with the admiral, and had been present almost all
the time when they were talking about the issue."And a very well spoken, distinguished and astute lady, she seemed to be,"
he continued; "asked more questions about the house and the conditions, and
taxes, than the admiral himself, and seemed more familiar with
business; and besides, Sir Walter, I found that she was not quite
disconnected in this country, nor her husband; that is to say,
she is the sister of a gentleman who once lived among us; she said
so herself: sister of the gentleman who lived a few years ago in
Monkford.Bless me! what was his name? At the moment i can't
remember his name, although I heard him so recently.Penelope, my
dear, can you help me on behalf of the gentleman who lived in
Monkford: Mrs. Croft's brother? "

But Mrs. Clay spoke so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she did not
hear the call.“I have no idea who you can tell, Shepherd; I do not remember
gentleman residing in Monkford since the days of old Governor Trent."

“Bless me! It's strange ! I'll soon forget my own name, I guess.A name that I know so well; therefore knew the gentleman
in full view; I have seen it a hundred times; came to consult me ​​once, I
remember, about an intrusion from one of his neighbors; farmer
break into his orchard; demolished wall; stolen apples; caught in the
made; and then, contrary to my judgment, subjected to a
amicable compromise.Very strange indeed! "

After waiting another moment -

"You mean Mr. Wentworth, I suppose?" said Anne.Mr. Shepherd was all gratitude."Wentworth was the very name! Mr. Wentworth was the very man.He had
Monkford's cure, you know, Sir Walter, some time ago for two
or three years.I came around year --- 5, I guess.You
remember him I'm sure."

"Wentworth? Oh yes, - Mr. Wentworth, the parish priest of Monkford.you were mistaken
me by the term gentleman.I thought you were talking about a man from
property: Mr. Wentworth was no one, I remember; completely disconnected;
nothing to do with the Strafford family.We wonder how the names of
many of our nobles become so common."

As Mr. Shepherd saw that this Croft connection made no sense to them
service with Sir Walter, he did not mention it again; back, with everything
his zeal, to dwell more indisputably on the circumstances in their
promote; their age, number and fortune; the high idea they had
formed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for the benefit of
to rent; giving the impression that they were nothing beyond
happiness to be the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot: an extraordinary
taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in Sir's secret
Walter's estimate of tenant contributions.He succeeded, however; and although Sir Walter must never look with a
evil eye on anyone who intends to inhabit this house, and think about it
infinitely too easy to be able to rent it from the highest
terms, he was persuaded to allow Mr. Shepherd to proceed in the
treaty, and allowing him to wait for Admiral Croft, who
stayed in Taunton and set a day for the house to be seen.Sir Walter was not very wise; but he still had enough experience of
world to feel, than a more irreproachable tenant, in the essential,
that Admiral Croft didn't claim to be fair, could hardly offer.So far has gone his
comprehension; and his vanity brought a little more appeasement, in
the admiral's living situation, which was just high enough, and not
too high."I rented my house to Admiral Croft", one would say
extremely well; much better than any simple M ...; an M (except,
maybe, half a dozen in the nation), still needs a grade
explanation.An admiral speaks of his own consequence, and at the same time
time, can never make a baronet look small.In all their relationships and
intercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must always take precedence.Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth: but her
the inclination was becoming so strong for a move that she was happy to
have it repaired and shipped by a tenant at hand; and not a word to
the suspension decision was pronounced by her.Mr. Shepherd was fully empowered to act; and hardly had such
reached, that Anne, who had been listening most attentively to
the whole thing, left the room, to seek the comfort of the fresh air for her
reddened cheeks; and as she walked along a favorite grove, said, with a
soft sigh, "A few more months, and maybe he's walking here."



Chapter 4


He was not Mr. Wentworth, the former vicar of Monkford, however
suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth, his
brother, who was appointed commander following the action off St
Domingo, and not immediately employed, had come to Somersetshire, in
summer 1806; and having no living relatives, found a home for half
one year at Monkford.He was, at that time, a remarkably handsome young man,
with great intelligence, wit and brilliance; and Anne an
extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste and feeling.Half of the sum of attraction, on each side, could have been sufficient, to
he had nothing to do, and she had hardly anyone to love; but the
meeting such lavish recommendations could not fail.They were
gradually familiarized, and once known, quickly and deeply in love.It would be difficult to say who experienced the highest perfection in the
other, or who had been the happiest: she, receiving her
declarations and proposals, or he has them accepted.A short period of exquisite bliss followed, and but a short.Problems soon arose.Sir Walter, after being asked, without actually
withholding consent, or saying it should never be, gave her all the
negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence and
declared the resolution to do nothing for his daughter.He thought so
a very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, but with more temperament
and forgivable pride, received him as one of the most unhappy.Anne Elliot, with all her pretensions of birth, beauty and wit, to throw
herself at nineteen; get involved at nineteen in a commitment
with a young man, who had nothing but himself to recommend it, and not
hopes of attaining wealth, but in the chances of a more uncertain
profession, and no connection to ensure even its greatest ascent in the
profession, would, indeed, be a scrapping, which she regretted
think about! Anne Elliot, so young; known by so few, to be snatched
by a stranger without alliance or fortune; or rather sunk by him in a
the most tiring, anxious and murderous state of addiction of youth! He must not
be, if by a fair interference of friendship, representations of
the one who had almost the love of a mother, and the rights of the mother, it would be
stop.Captain Wentworth had no fortune.He had been lucky in his profession;
but spending freely, which came for free, achieved nothing.But
he was convinced that he would soon be rich: full of life and ardor,
he knew he should soon have a ship, and soon be on a station which
would lead to whatever he wanted.He had always been lucky; they had
he should be so calm.Such confidence, powerful in its own warmth,
and bewitching in the spirit that often expressed it, had to be
enough for Anne; but Lady Russell saw it very differently.His
sanguine temperament and fearlessness of mind operated very differently on
her.She saw only an aggravation of the evil.He only added a
dangerous character for himself.He was brilliant, he was stubborn.Lady Russell had little taste for the wit and for everything that came close
recklessness a horror.She belittled the connection from every angle.Such opposition, as produced by these feelings, was more than Anne
fight.Young and sweet as she was, it might still have been possible
resist his father's ill will, though not softened by a kind word
or watch from his sister; but Lady Russell, whom she had
always loved and called upon, could not, with such firmness of opinion,
and such tenderness so, counsel her continually in vain.She was persuaded to believe in the engagement a bad thing: indiscreet,
unfit, hardly able to succeed, and not deserving it.But it was
not a simple selfish warning, under which she acted, ending
to him.Had she not imagined consulting her property, even more
than hers, she could hardly have given up.The belief to be
prudent, and renouncing herself, chiefly to her advantage, was her leader
consolation, under the misery of a separation, of a final separation; and every
consolation was necessary, for she had to face all the others
pain of opinions, on his side, totally unconvinced and inflexible, and
to feel badly used by such forced abandonment.He had
left the country as a result.A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;
but not with a few months Anne's part suffered from it.Her
attachment and regret have long clouded any enjoyment of
youth, and an early loss of flowering and spirits had been their
effect.More than seven years have passed since this little story of sadness
interest had reached its end; and the weather had softened a lot,
perhaps almost all had a special attachment to him, but she had been too
dependent on time alone; no help was given to change location
(except in a single visit to Bath shortly after the break-up), or in any novelty
or enlargement of the company.No one had ever been to the Kellynch
circle, which could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth, for he
stood in his memory.No second attachment, the only one deep down
natural, happy and sufficient healing at the time of his life had been
possible with the pleasant tone of his mind, the thoroughness of his taste,
within the small limits of the society around them.She was
asked, around twenty-two, to change his name, by the young
man, who soon after found a more voluntary spirit in his younger
sister; and Lady Russell had deplored his refusal; for Charles Musgrove
was the eldest son of a man, whose landowner and general
of importance were second in this country, only to Sir Walter, and of
good character and appearance; and yet Lady Russell could have
asked something more, when Anne was nineteen, she would have
is delighted to see her at the age of twenty-two so respectably removed from
bias and injustice of his father's house, and thus settled
near her at all times.But in this case, Anne had left nothing for
advice to do; and although Lady Russell, still so satisfied with her
own discretion, never wished the past to come undone, now she has started to have the
an anxiety that borders on despair that Anne is tempted, by some
a man of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held
that she is particularly adapted by her warm affections and her domestic habits.They did not know the opinion of the other, neither its consistency nor its evolution,
on the only main point of Anne's conduct, because the subject has never been
refers to; but Anne, at seven and twenty, thought very differently
of what she had been led to think of nineteen.she didn't blame
Lady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her;
but she felt that when very young, in similar circumstances,
ask her for advice, they would never get any
immediate misery, good future so uncertain.She was persuaded
that under every disadvantage of disapproval at home, and every
anxiety related to his profession, all their probable fears, delays and
disappointments, yet she should have been a happier woman in
maintain the commitment, than it had been in the sacrifice of this one;
and that, she well believed, had the usual part, had even more than
the usual part of all these solicitations and suspensions was theirs,
without reference to the actual results of their case, which, as it
happened, would have conferred a prosperity earlier than that which could have been
reasonably calculated on.All his optimistic hopes, all his
the trust had been justified.His genius and his ardor had seemed
to foresee and order his prosperous path.He had, very soon after
their engagement ended, got a job: and all he told her would be
to follow, had taken place.He had distinguished himself, and early
has gained the other echelon and must now, by successive captures,
made a great fortune.She only had lists from the navy and newspapers
for his authority, but she could not doubt his wealth; and in
favor of his constancy, she had no reason to believe him married.How eloquent Anne Elliot could have been! how eloquent at least they were
her wishes on the side of warm early attachment, and a merry
confidence in the future, against this overly anxious prudence which seems
insult effort and beware of Providence! She had been forced to
caution in her youth, she learns romance as she ages: the
natural consequence of an unnatural beginning.With all these circumstances, memories and feelings, she couldn't
hear that Captain Wentworth's sister would probably live in Kellynch
without revival of previous pain; and many walks, and many sighs,
were needed to dispel the agitation of the idea.She often said
it was madness herself, before she could harden her nerves enough
to feel the continual discussion of Crofts and their unsuccessful affairs
wrong.Yet she was helped by this perfect indifference and
apparent unconsciousness, among the only three of his own friends
the secret of the past, which seemed to almost deny any memory of
he.She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell's motives
in this, on those of his father and Elizabeth; she could honor everything
the best feelings of his calm; but the general air of oblivion
among them was very important all that he sprang; and in the
event of the capture of Kellynch Hall by Admiral Croft, she rejoices again
on the conviction that had always been most grateful to him, of
past being known to these three only among his relations, by whom no
syllable, she believed, would never be whispered, and in the confidence that
of his family, the only brother with whom he had resided, had
received information about their short engagement.This brother
had been long out of the country and being a sane man, and,
moreover, a single man at the time, she had a loving dependence on no
human creature has heard of him.The sister, Mrs Croft, was then out of England, accompanying her
husband on a foreign station, and his own sister, Mary, had been to
school while it all happened; and never admitted by the pride of some,
and the delicacy of others, at the slightest knowledge after.With these supports, she hoped that knowledge between her
and the Croft family, who, along with Lady Russell, still reside in Kellynch,
and Mary set just three miles away, must be anticipated, no need
involve a particular discomfort.Chapter 5


The morning scheduled for Admiral and Mrs. Croft to see Kellynch
Hall, Anne found it more natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady
Russell, and stay away until it's all over; when she found him
most natural to be sorry for missing the opportunity to see
them.This meeting of the two parties turned out to be very satisfactory and decided
the whole company at once.Every woman was previously well disposed to
agreement, and therefore saw only good manners in the
other; and as for the gentlemen, there was such a good
humor, a liberality so open and confident on the side of the admiral, as
could only influence Sir Walter, who had moreover been flattered
his best and most polite demeanor by the assurances of Mr. Shepherd
of his being known, in relation, to the admiral, as a model of good
reproduction.The house, land and furniture have been approved, the Croft's have been
approved, terms, time, everything and everyone was right; and M.
The shepherd's clerks set to work, without a single
preliminary difference to modify all this "This act."

Sir Walter, without hesitation, declared that the admiral was the
the most handsome sailor he had ever met, and went so far as to say:
that if her own man could have had the arrangement of her hair, he should have
don't be ashamed to be seen with him anywhere; and the admiral, with
sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife as they returned
the park, "I thought we should make a deal soon, my dear, despite
of what they told us in Taunton.The baronet will never set the Thames
on fire, but there doesn't seem to be any harm in him."--reciprocal
compliments, which would have been considered roughly equal.The Croft's were to have possession at Saint-Michel; and like Sir Walter
offered to move to Bath within the previous month, he
there was no time to waste making each dependent arrangement.Lady Russell, convinced that Anne would not have the right to be of any
use, or any importance, in choosing the house from which they were
go to safety, was very unwilling to make her leave so soon,
and wanted to allow her to stay back until she could
bring her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having commitments of
hers, which was to take her from Kellynch for several weeks, she was
unable to give the full invitation she wanted, and Anne dreading
the possible heat of September in all the white shine of Bath, and
distressed to renounce all the so sweet and sad influence of the
autumn month in the country, I did not think that, all
considered, she wished to stay.It would be the fairest, and the most
wise, and therefore must involve the least amount of suffering to go with others.Something happened, however, to give her a different duty.Mary, often
a little sick, and always thinking a lot about his
complaints, and always in the habit of calling Anne when something was
matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing that she shouldn't have
the health of the day all fall, begged her, or rather demanded her
was hardly begging, to come to Uppercross Cottage and carry her
company as long as she should want it, instead of going to Bath."I probably can't do without Anne," was Mary's reasoning; and
Elizabeth's response was, "So I'm sure Anne better stay, for no one.
will want her in Bath."

To be claimed as a good, although in an inappropriate style, is at least
better than being dismissed as not at all good; and Anne, happy to be
thought of some use, happy to have something marked as a duty, and
certainly not sorry to have the scene in the country, and hers
dear country, gladly agreed to stay.This invitation from Mary removed all of Lady Russell's hardships, and
it was therefore soon decided that Anne would not go to Bath before
Lady Russell took her, and that all the split time should be
divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.So far everything was going perfectly well; but Lady Russell was almost surprised by
the wrong part of Kellynch Hall's plan, when it broke out on her,
that is, Mrs. Clay was engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and
Elizabeth, as the latter's most important and valuable assistant
all the business in front of her.Lady Russell was extremely sorry that
we should have resorted to such a measure, wondering, complaining,
and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne, in the fact that Mrs. Clay
of such use, when Anne could be of no use, was very painful
aggravation.Anne herself had hardened herself to such affronts; but she felt the
the recklessness of the arrangement just as keenly as Lady Russell.With a
a lot of quiet observation and an acquaintance that she often has
wished less, of the character of her father, she was sensitive that it resulted
the most serious for his family's intimacy were over
possible.She didn't imagine her father now had an idea
of the kind.Mrs. Clay had freckles and a protruding tooth, and a
awkward wrist, on which he continually made harsh remarks,
his absence ; but she was young, and certainly quite beautiful,
and possessed, in a quick wit and hardworking and agreeable ways,
attractions infinitely more dangerous than any purely personal power
has been.Anne was so impressed with the degree of their danger, that
she couldn't apologize for trying to make it noticeable to him
sister.She had little hope of success; but Elizabeth, who in the
event of such a setback would be so much more to be pitied than
herself, should never, she thought, have reason to blame him
giving no warning.She spoke and didn't seem to offend.Elizabeth couldn't conceive how
such an absurd suspicion should occur to him, and replied indignantly
so that each party knows their situation perfectly.“Mrs. Clay,” he said, warmly, “never forget who she is; and as i am
better aware of his feelings than you can be, I can
make sure that on the subject of marriage, they are particularly
kind, and that she condemns any inequality of status and rank more
strongly than most people.And as for my father, I really shouldn't
thought that he, who has been celibate for so long for our
sakes, we must guess now.If Mrs. Clay was a very beautiful woman,
I grant you, it might be wrong to have him so much with me; not that
anything in the world, I'm sure, would make my dad make a
degrading match, but it could be made miserable.But poor Mrs. Clay
who, with all its merits, can never have been counted enough
pretty, I really think poor Mrs. Clay can stay here in perfect
security.You could imagine that you never heard my father talk about her
personal woes, although I know you owe fifty times.This tooth
of her and those freckles.Freckles don't disgust me so much
as they do.I have known a face not materially disfigured by a
little, but he abominates them.You must have heard him notice that Mrs. Clay
freckles."

"There is hardly any personal fault," replied Anne, "which a
a pleasant way might not gradually come to terms with."

“I think very differently,” Elizabeth replied, shortly; "a pleasant
the way can trigger beautiful features, but can never alter simple ones.However, anyway, as I have a lot more stakes on this
point that anyone else can have, I think it's pretty useless in you
advise me."

Anne had done; glad it's over, and not absolutely desperate to
do well.Elizabeth, though feeling the suspicion, might still be
made observer by him.The last office of the four carriage horses was to draw Sir Walter,
Miss Elliot and Mrs. Clay in Bath.The party went very well
spirits; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all
distressed tenants and cottage owners who may have had a clue to show
themselves, and Anne was walking at the same time, in a kind of desolation
tranquility, at the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week.Her friend was not in a better mood than herself.Lady Russell felt
this family breakup extremely.Their respectability was also
which was dear to him like his own, and daily intercourse had become precious by
habit.It was painful to contemplate their desert lands, and yet
worse to anticipate the new hands they would fall into; and to escape
the loneliness and melancholy of a village so thirsty, and go out
out of the way when the Admiral and Mrs. Croft first arrived, she had determined
to start her own absence from home when she has to abandon Anne.As a result, their move was made together, and Anne was dropped off at
Uppercross Cottage, on the first leg of Lady Russell's journey.Uppercross was a medium-sized village which a few years ago had
been completely in the old English style, containing only two houses
superior in appearance to those of yeomen and workers; the
the squire's house, with its high walls, its large doors and its old trees,
substantial and not modernized, and the presbytery compact and tight,
enclosed in its own well-kept garden, with a vine and a trellised pear tree
around its leaves; but during the marriage of the young squire, he had
received the improvement of a farmhouse raised in a chalet, for
his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda,
windows, and the like, were just as likely to catch the
the eye of the traveler as the most consistent and significant aspect and
premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile away.Here, Anne had often stayed.She knew the Uppercross tracks like
as well as those of Kellynch.The two families were so continuously
meeting, so in the habit of running in and out of each other
house at all hours, that it was rather a surprise for her to find Mary
alone; but being alone her uneasiness and state of mind was almost
An evidence.Although better endowed than the older sister, Mary
did not have the understanding or temperament of Anne.So good, and happy, and
well looked after, she had a great good humor and an excellent mood;
but all indisposition sank her completely.She had no resources for
solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot
sufficiency, was very inclined to add to any other distress that of
believing oneself to be neglected and misused.In person, she was less than
the two sisters, and had, even in its flower, only attained the dignity of
to be "a beautiful girl."She was now lying on the pretty faded sofa.
small living room whose formerly elegant furniture had been
progressively shabby, under the influence of four summers and two
children; and, when Anne appeared, greeted her with ...

"So you finally came! I started to think I should never see you.I
am so sick i can barely speak.I haven't seen a creature at all
Morning!"

"I'm sorry to find you sick," Anne replied.."You sent me such
good account of you Thursday! "

"Yes, I got the most out of it; I still do: but I was very far from being well
at the time; and i don't think i've ever been as sick in my life as i have been
been all this morning: very unfit to be left alone I'm sure.Suppose I'm suddenly gripped in a terrible way, and no
able to ring the bell! So Lady Russell wouldn't come out.I do not
think she's been in this house three times this summer."

Anne said what was right and inquired about her husband."Oh!
Charles is shooting.I haven't seen him for seven hours.He
would go, even if i told him how sick i was.He said he shouldn't stay
outside for a long time; but he never came back, and now he's almost a.I
assure you, I haven't seen a soul all this long morning."

"Did you have your little boys with you?"

"Yes, as long as I can take their noise; but they're so unmanageable
That they do me more harm than good.Little Charles does not take care of a
word I say, and Walter is also growing poorly."

"Well, you'll soon be better now," Anne replied happily.."You
i know i always heal you when i come.How are your neighbors in
Beautiful house?"

"I can't tell you.I haven't seen one
today, with the exception of Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke
window, but without dismounting; and although i told him how
I was sick, none of them were near me.He did not get to
suitable for Miss Musgroves I guess, and they never get angry
out of their way."

"You will see them again, maybe, before the morning is over.It is
early."

"I never want them, I assure you.They talk and laugh a lot too
a lot for me.Oh! Anne, I am so sick! It was pretty mean
you must not come thursday."

"My dear Mary, remember what a comfortable story you sent me
yourself! You wrote in the happiest way and said you were
perfectly fine, and in no hurry for me; and this being the case, you
must be aware that my wish would be to stay with Lady Russell at the
last: and in addition to how I felt for her, I really was
busy, I had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently
left Kellynch earlier."

“Dear me! What can you have to do?”

"Lots of things, I assure you.More than I can remember in one
moment; but I can tell you.I made a copy of the
catalog of books and pictures of my father.I have been several times
in the garden with Mackenzie, trying to figure it out and make him
understand, what Elizabeth plants are for Lady Russell.I have
I had all my little worries to arrange, books and music to share,
and all my trunks to recondition, not having understood in time what
was intended for carts: and one thing I had to do, Marie,
of a more trying nature: going to almost all the houses of the parish, like
a kind of departure.I was told they wished it.But all these
things were taking a long time."

"Never mind!" and after a moment of pause, "but you never asked me
a word about our dinner at Pooles yesterday."

"Did you go then?" I did not do any investigation, because I concluded you
must have been forced to give up the party."

"Oh yes! I went.I was fine yesterday; nothing at all the problem
with me until this morning.It would have been strange if I hadn't
faded away."

"I am very happy that you are doing quite well, and I hope you had a pleasant
Party."

"Nothing remarkable.We always know in advance what dinner will be
to be, and who will be there; and it's so uncomfortable not to have
transport of its own.Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove took me, and we were so
cluttered! They are both so big and take up so much space; and M.
Musgrove is still sitting forward.So there was me, tight in the back
sits with Henrietta and Louisa; and I think it is very likely that my
the disease today may be due to it."

A little more perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on
Anne's side almost produced a cure on Mary's.She could sit down soon
standing on the couch, and began to hope that she could let him in
dinner time.Then forgetting to think about it, she was on the other end
of the room, embellishing a bouquet; then she ate her cold meat; and
then she was good enough to suggest a little walk."Where should we go?" she said when they were ready."I guess you
will not like to go to the Grande Maison before going to see
you?"

"I don't have the slightest objection to this," replied Anne.."I
should never think of participating in such a ceremony with people whom I
as well as Mrs. and the Miss Musgroves."

"Oh! But they should call on you ASAP.They should
feel what is owed to you as my sister.However, we may as well go
and sit with them a little while, and when we're done, we can
enjoy our walk."

Anne had always found such a style of reporting very imprudent;
but she had stopped trying to stop him, to believe that,
whether there were continuing subjects of infringement on either side, neither
the family could now do without it.At the Big House as a result they
went to sit for half an hour in the old-fashioned square living room,
with a small carpet and a shiny floor, to which the girls present
of the house gradually gave the air of confusion by a
grand piano and a harp, flowers and small tables placed in
all the senses.Oh! the originals of the portraits against the
paneling, the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue
satin saw what was happening, were aware of such
reversal of all order and cleanliness! The portraits themselves seemed
to be amazed.The Musgroves, like their homes, were in a state of deterioration,
maybe improvement.Father and mother were in Old English
style, and young people of the new.Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove were a
very good kind of people; friendly and hospitable, little educated,
and not at all elegant.Their children had a more modern mind and
manners.There was a large family; but the only two grew up,
with the exception of Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa, young ladies of nineteen
and twenty, who had brought all the usual stock from school to Exeter
of achievements, and were now like thousands of other young girls,
live to be fashionable, happy and cheerful.Their dress had it all
advantage, their faces were rather pretty, their spirits extremely
good, their unhindered and pleasant manner; they were important
at home and favorites abroad.Anne always considered them to be
of the happiest creatures of his knowledge; but still, saved like us
all are, by a comfortable feeling of superiority to wish
the possibility of exchange, she would not have abandoned hers
elegant and cultivated spirit for all their pleasures; and envied them
nothing but this good understanding and this seemingly perfect agreement
together, this mutual affection of good humor, which she had known
so little herself with one of her sisters.They were received with great cordiality.Nothing seemed to go wrong on the
family side Great House, who was generally, like Anne very well
knew, the least to blame.The half hour was pleasantly chatted
sufficient; and she was not at all surprised, in the end, to have
their marching group joined by the two Miss Musgroves, at Mary's
special invitation.Chapter 6


Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, only to learn that a move
from one group of people to another, albeit at a distance of only three
miles, will often include a total change in conversation, opinion and
idea.She had never been there before, without being struck by
or without wishing that other Elliots can have his advantage
seeing how unknown or inconsiderate there were the affairs which
Kellynch Hall were treated as such general and ubiquitous publicity
interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed that she now had to
submit to feeling that another lesson, in the art of knowing ours
nothingness beyond our own circle had become necessary for him; for
certainly, coming like her, with a heart full of the subject who
had completely occupied Kellynch's two houses for many weeks,
she had expected more curiosity and sympathy than she found in
the separate but very similar remark from Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove: "So, miss
Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of bath are you doing
do you think they will settle down? »Without waiting too long for a
reply; or in the addition of the maidens of: "I hope we will be in
Bath in winter; but remember, daddy, if we go we have to be in a
good situation: none of your Queen Squares for us!
Mary's supplement, from - "On my word, I'll be fine enough,
when you are all gone to be happy in Bath! "

She could only bring herself to avoid such an illusion in the future, and think
with increased gratitude for the extraordinary blessing of having a
a friend as sympathetic as Lady Russell.The Mr. Musgroves had their own game of guarding and destroying their own
horses, dogs and logs to engage them, and females were fully
busy with all other common household matters, neighbors,
dress, dance and music.She recognized that it was very appropriate,
that each small social Commonwealth should dictate its own questions of
speech; and hoped, in a short time, to become a non-unworthy member of the
the one she was now transplanted into.With the prospect of spending at
at least two months at Uppercross, it was his responsibility to
dress his imagination, his memory and all his ideas in as many
Uppercross as possible.She had no fear of these two months.Marie was not so repulsive and
unhappy like Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to any influence of hers;
there was also nothing among the other constituent elements of the
chalet hostile to comfort.She was always on good terms with her
brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved him almost as well, and
respected her much more than their mother, she had an object of
interest, fun and healthy effort.Charles Musgrove was courteous and amiable; in sense and temper, he was
no doubt superior to his wife, but no powers, no conversation,
or grace, to make the past, as they were bound together, a
dangerous contemplation; however, at the same time, Anne could believe,
with Lady Russell, that a more equal game could have improved greatly
him; and that a woman with real understanding could have given more
consequence to his character, and more utility, rationality and
elegance to its habits and activities.As it is, he did nothing with
a lot of zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise lightly, without
enjoy books or whatever.He had a very good mood, which
never seemed much affected by his wife's occasional meanness, bored with
his unreasonable character at times to Anne's admiration, and on the
as a whole, although there was very often a small disagreement (in which she
sometimes had more of a share than she wanted, being solicited by both
parties), they could pass for a happy couple.They were always
fully agree on the need for more money, and a strong inclination
for a nice gift from his father; but here, as in most subjects, it
had superiority, because even if Marie found it very unfortunate that such
a gift was not given, he always claimed that his father had
many other uses of their money and the right to spend it as they see fit.As for the management of their children, his theory was much better than
his wife, and his practice not so bad."I could handle them very
well, if it weren't for Mary's interference, "that was often what Anne
heard it said, and had a lot of faith in; but listening
turn to Mary's reproach: "Charles spoils the children so that I
can't put them in any order, "she never had the slightest temptation
to say: "Very true."

One of the least pleasant circumstances of his residence was his
to be treated with too much confidence by all parties, and to be too
well in the secrecy of the complaints of each house.Known to have some
influence with her sister, she was continuously solicited, or at least
receive advice on how to exercise it, beyond what was possible."I wish you
could persuade Mary not to think she was still ill, ”was
the language of Charles; and, in a bad mood, Marie spoke thus:
believe that if Charles saw me die, he wouldn't think that there is
all that matters to me.I'm sure, Anne, if you want you could
convince him that I am really, really sick - much worse than ever
clean."

Mary's statement was: "I hate sending children to the Grand
House, although their grandmother still wants to see them, because she
moods and spoils them to such a degree, and gives them so much
garbage and sugary things, which they are sure to come back sick and walk through
for the rest of the day."And Mrs. Musgrove took the first opportunity
to be alone with Anne, to say: "Oh! Miss Anne, I can't help but wish
Mrs. Charles had a little of your method with these children.They are
quite different creatures with you! But to be sure, in general, they
are so spoiled! It's a shame that you can't put your sister in the way of
manage them.They are children as beautiful as ever seen,
poor dear ones! without bias; but Mrs. Charles does not know any more
how they should be treated -! Bless me! how annoying they are
sometimes.I assure you, Miss Anne, that prevents me from wanting to see them
with us as often as I should otherwise.I believe Mrs. Charles is
not quite happy not to invite them more often; but you know it is
very bad to have children with one that we have to check
each moment; “Don't do that” and “don't do that”; where we can
only keep in an order tolerable by more cake than is good for them."

She also had this communication from Marie."Mrs. Musgrove thinks
all his servants so steadfast that it would be a high treason to call him
question; but I'm sure, without exaggeration, that his stem
chambermaid and cleaning lady, instead of being in their company, are
strolling through the village all day.I meet them everywhere I go;
and I declare, I never enter my nursery twice without seeing
something of them.If Jemima was not the most faithful, the most stable
creature in the world, it would suffice to spoil her; because she tells
me, they always try her to walk with them."And on Ms.
On the Musgrove side, it was: "I make it a rule never to interfere in any of the
the concerns of my daughter-in-law, because I know that would not be the case; but I will
tell you, Miss Anne, because you might be able to fix things,
that I do not have a very good opinion of Mme Charles' nanny: I mean
strange stories from her; she's still on the gadget; and mine
knowledge, I can declare, she is such a well dressed woman, that she is
enough to ruin all the servants she approaches.Mrs. Charles swears quite
by it, I know; but i just gave you this hint, that you may be on the
Look; because, if you see something wrong, you don't need to be afraid of
by mentioning it."

Again, this was Mary's complaint, which Ms Musgrove was very likely not to
give it the precedence it deserved, when they dined at the Grand
House with other families; and she saw no reason why she was
to be considered at home to the point of losing one's place.And one day
when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them after
speaking of rank, of people of rank and jealousy of rank, said: "I have not
scruple to watch you, how foolish some people are
their place, because everyone knows how easy and indifferent you are
are about it; but I wish someone could give Mary a clue that he would be
would be much better if she wasn't so tenacious, especially if
she wouldn't always show up to take mum's place.No one doubts her right to take precedence over mom, but it would be
more suitable in her not to always insist on it.It is not that
momma cares the least, but I know it's taken
opinion of several people."

How did Anne settle all these rights questions? She couldn't do much
more than patiently listening, softening every grievance and excusing everyone
The other; give them all the clues of the patience needed between
those close neighbors, and expand the clues that have been served
for the benefit of his sister.In all other respects his visit started and went very well.Her
own spirits improved by the change of place and subject, by being removed
three miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments were lessened by having a
constant companion, and their daily relationships with the other family,
for there was no affection, confidence or superior job
in the chalet, to be interrupted, it was rather an advantage.He
was certainly worn almost as far as possible, as they encountered every
morning, and hardly ever spent a separate evening; but she believed
they shouldn't have done so well without the sight of Mr. and Mrs.
The respectable forms of Musgrove in the usual places, or without the
talk, laugh and sing their daughters.She performed much better than either of the Miss Musgroves, but
having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no loving parents, to sit
by and imagine themselves delighted, his performance was little thought
of, only out of civility, or to refresh others, because she was fine
aware.She knew that when she played, she only pleased
himself; but it was not a new feeling.With the exception of a short period of
her life, she had never, since the age of fourteen, never since the
the loss of his dear mother, known the happiness of being listened to, or
encouraged by a fair appreciation or a real taste.In music, she had
always been used to feeling alone in the world; and that of Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove
affectionate bias for the performance of their own daughters, and total
indifference to any other person, gave him much more pleasure to
their good, that mortification for itself.The party at the Grande Maison was sometimes augmented by another company.The neighborhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited by
everyone, and had more dinners, and more callers, more visitors
by invitation and by chance, more than any other family.They were more
completely popular.The girls were crazy to dance; and the evenings ended, from time to time,
in a small non-premeditated ball.There was a family of cousins ​​inside
an Uppercross walk, under less well-off circumstances, which depended on
the Musgroves for all their pleasures: they came at any time,
and help to play anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne, a lot
preferring the office of a musician to a more active position, played country
dance for them on time together; a kindness that always
recommended his musical powers to the attention of Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove
more than anything else, and often attracted this compliment; - "Good game,
Miss Anne! very well done indeed! Lord bless me! how these little ones
your fingers fly! "

So spent the first three weeks.Michaelmas came; and now Anne's heart
must be in Kellynch again.A beloved home given to others; all
precious pieces and furniture, groves and prospects, which are beginning to become owners
other eyes and other limbs! She couldn't think of much else on the
September 29; and she had that nice touch in the evening
of Mary who, having had the opportunity to note the day of the month,
exclaimed: "Dear me, isn't this the day the Crofts were to come?
Kellynch? I'm glad I didn't think about it before.How low it is
me!"

The Crofts took possession with genuine naval vigilance, and were to be
visited.Mary lamented the need for herself."No one knew how
she should suffer a lot.She should postpone it as long as she could; "
but it wasn't easy until she convinced Charles to drive her
early, and was in a very lively and comfortable state of
imaginary restlessness, when she came back.Anne had very sincerely
rejoices that there is no way for her to go.However, she wished
see the Crofts, and was happy to be inside when the tour went.They came: the master of the house was not at home, but both
the sisters were together; and as it so happened that Mrs. Croft fell into the hands of the
part of Anne, while the admiral was seated next to Marie, and was very
pleasant by her cheerful opinion of her little boys, she was well
able to watch a resemblance, and if that failed him in features, to
catch it in the voice, or in the turn of feeling and expression.Mrs. Croft, although neither tall nor fat, had a set square, an uprightness,
and the vigor of the form, which gave importance to his person.She had
shiny dark eyes, good teeth, and quite a pleasant face; But
her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, a consequence of her
to have been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her appear
lived a few more years in the world than his real eight and thirty.His manners were open, easy and determined, like someone who had no suspicion
of itself, and no doubts about what to do; without any approach to
rudeness, however, or any lack of good humor.Anne gave her credit,
indeed, for feelings of great consideration towards herself, in all
which concerned Kellynch, and that pleased her: especially since she had
satisfied from the first half-minute, at the very moment of
introduction, that there was not the slightest symptom of any knowledge
or suspicion on Ms. Croft's side, to give bias of any kind.She was
fairly easy on this head, and therefore full of strength and courage,
until a moment electrified by Mrs. Croft suddenly said: -

"It was you, and not your sister, I think my brother had the
pleasure to meet, when he was in this country."

Anne hoped she had survived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion
she certainly didn't."Maybe you haven't heard that he's married?" Ms. Croft added.She could now answer properly; and was happy to feel, when Mrs.
Croft's next words explained that it was Mr. Wentworth she was talking about,
that she didn't say anything that couldn't do for either brother.It
immediately sensed how reasonable it was that Ms. Croft was
to think and speak of Edward, and not of Frederick; and with shame
to his own oblivion applied to the knowledge of their
the current state of the former neighbor with a legitimate interest.The rest was peace; until the moment they moved, she
heard the admiral say to Mary:

“We're expecting a brother from Mrs. Croft here soon; I dare to tell you
know him by name."

He was cut short by the impatient attacks of the little boys, clinging to
him as an old friend, and stating that he shouldn't go; and be too
very absorbed by the proposals to take them in the pockets of his coat,
&vs., have another moment to finish or remember what he had
started, Anne had to convince herself, as best she could, that
the same brother must still be involved.However, she could not
achieve such a degree of certainty that he is not eager to hear if
nothing had been said about it in the other house, where the
Crofts had already called.The people of the Great House were to spend the evening of that day at
the cottage; and it is now too late in the year for such visits to
to be done on foot, the coach began to be listened to, when the
youngest Miss Musgrove came in.That she came to apologize,
and that they were to spend the evening alone, was the
first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be offended, when Louisa
does well by saying that she only came on foot, to leave more
place for the harp, which brought the car.“And I'll tell you our reason,” she added, “and all about it.I am
come and warn you, that mom and dad are in a bad mood this
in the evening, especially mom; she thinks so much of poor Richard!
And we agreed that it would be better to have the harp, because it sounds like fun
she more than the pianoforte.I'll tell you why she's out of
spirits.When the Crofts called this morning, (they called here
afterwards, is not it?), they sometimes said that his brother,
Captain Wentworth, just returned to England, or paid, or
something, and comes to see them almost directly; and more
unfortunately it came to mum's head, when they left, that
Wentworth, or something very similar, was poor Richard's name
captain at one point; I don't know when or where, but a good time
before you die, poor boy! And looking at his letters and
things, she has found to be so, and is perfectly sure that it must be
man himself, and his head is full of it, and poor Richard!
So we need to be as cheerful as possible, so that she doesn't linger on
things so dark."

The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,
that the Musgroves had had the bad luck of a very troublesome one,
hopeless son; and the chance to lose it before it reaches its
twentieth year; that he was sent to sea because he was stupid and
unmanageable on land; that he had been very poorly cared for
time by his family, although as much as he deserved; rarely heard
of, and hardly regretted, when the intelligence of his death
overseas had made its way to Uppercross two years previously.He had, in fact, although his sisters were now doing all they could to
he, calling him "poor Richard", was nothing better than a
Dick Musgrove, the thick-headed, insensitive and unprofitable, who had never done
anything that gives the right to more than the abbreviation of its name,
alive or dead.He had spent several years at sea and had, during these
the moves to which all aspirants are responsible, and in particular
midshipmen that every captain wishes to get rid of, for six months
board Captain Frederick Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and
Laconia, he had, under the influence of his captain, written the only
two letters his father and mother had never received from him
during his entire absence; that is to say the only two
selfless letters; everything else was just simple apps for
money.In each letter he had spoken of the good of his captain; but yet, so little
were they used to dealing with these questions, so few observers and
were they incurable as to the names of men or ships, which he had
almost no printing at the time; and that Mrs. Musgrove should have
was suddenly struck, that very day, by the memory of the name of
Wentworth, as related to her son, seemed one of those extraordinary
outbursts of mind that sometimes occur.She had gone to his letters and had found everything as she supposed; and the
rereading these letters, after such a long interval, his poor son
gone forever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten, had
affected her minds excessively, and threw her into greater sorrow for
him that she had not known him at the first hearing of his death.Mr. Musgrove was,
to a lesser degree, affected in the same way; and when they reached the
cottage, they obviously needed, first, to be listened to again
about it, and afterwards, of all the relief that
companions could give them.To hear them talk so much about Captain Wentworth, repeat his name
so often, confusing in years gone by, and finally making sure he
could, that he probably would, turn out to be the same captain
Wentworth whom they remembered having met, once or twice, after their
coming back from Clifton - a very fine young man - but they couldn't tell
whether it was seven or eight years ago, it was a new kind of trial for
Anne's nerves.She found, however, that this was a question she owed
inure herself.Since he was indeed expected in the country, she must
learns to be insensitive on such points.And not only
seems it was expected, and quickly, but the Musgroves, in their
warm gratitude for the kindness he had shown to poor Dick, and very high
respect for his character, marked as he was by poor Dick having been
six months in his custody, and mention it in strong, but not
perfectly spelled praise, like "a dashing handsome boy, only two
concerning the school teacher ", resolved to present
themselves, and seeking his knowledge, as soon as they heard of
His arrival.The resolve to do so helped shape the comfort of their evening.Chapter 7


A few more days, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at
Kellynch and Mr. Musgrove had called him, and came back warm in his
praise, and he was engaged with the Croft's to dine at Uppercross, by
the end of another week.It had been a great disappointment for Mr.
Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed, so impatient was
he to show his gratitude, seeing Captain Wentworth under his own
roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his
cellars.But a week must pass; only a week, according to Anne, and
so, she supposed, they had to meet; and soon she started to wish that she
could feel safe even for a week.Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr. Musgrove's civility,
and she called there almost in the same half hour.She and Marie
were in fact heading towards the Big House, where, like her
after learning, they must inevitably have found it, while they were
arrested by the elder being at this time brought home
consequence of a bad fall.The situation of the child put the visit
entirely to the side; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference,
even in the midst of the severe anxiety they then experienced
its account.His collarbone was found to be dislocated, and such an injury received in
the back, as aroused the most alarming ideas.It was an afternoon of
distress, and Anne had everything to do at the same time; the apothecary at
send to seek, the father for having pursued and informed, the mother for
to support and keep hysterics, the servants to control, the younger ones
a child to be banished, and the poor suffering to heal and appease;
in addition to sending, as soon as she remembers, an appropriate notice to the
another house, which brought him a rather frightened advent,
curious companions, what very useful assistants.The return of his brother was the first comfort; he could take care of
his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.Until he came and examined the child, their apprehensions were the
worse to be vague; they suspected a great wound, but did not know where;
but now the collarbone was soon replaced, and although Mr. Robinson felt
and smelled, and rubbed, and looked grave, and said low words both to the
father and aunt, they all had to hope for the best and be
able to part ways and eat dinner with tolerable peace of mind; so what
it is, just before separating, that the two young aunts were able to
far from deviating from their nephew's condition, as if to give
Captain Wentworth's visit; stay five minutes behind their father and
mother, to try to express how thrilled they were to
him, how much more beautiful, how infinitely more pleasant they found him
than any of their male acquaintances, who had been at all
a favorite before.How happy they had been to hear daddy invite him to
Stay for dinner, as he's sorry when he said it was totally out of his power, and
how happy still when he had promised in reply to mom and dad
further, pressing for invitations to come and dine with them on the
tomorrow - actually the next day; and he had promised it in such a pleasant
way, as if he felt the whole motive of their attention just as he
should.And in short, he had watched and said everything with such
exquisite grace, that they could assure them all, their heads were both
turned by him; and they fled, just as full of joy as of love, and
apparently fuller of Captain Wentworth than little Charles.The same story and the same raptures are repeated, when the two girls
came with their father, in the evening twilight, to do
ask for information; and Mr. Musgrove, who is no longer under the first malaise
his heir, could add his confirmation and praise, and hope
now be no opportunity to put Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry
to think that the cottage party, probably, would not want to leave the
little boy, to meet him." Oh no ; as for leaving the little one
boy ", the father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm
endure the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape, could not help
adding his warm protests to theirs.Charles Musgrove, in fact, subsequently showed more inclination; "the
child was doing so well, and he wanted so much to be introduced to
Captain Wentworth, that perhaps he could join them in the evening; he
wouldn't have dinner at home, but he could come in for half an hour." But
in this he was strongly opposed by his wife, with "Oh no, indeed,
Charles, I can't stand you leaving.Only think if something
should happen? "

The child had a good night's sleep, and was fine the next day.He
should be a long time job to ensure that no injury has been inflicted on the
spine; but Mr. Robinson found nothing to raise the alarm, and Charles
Musgrove began, therefore, to no longer feel the need
confinement.The child was to be kept in bed and entertained as discreetly as
possible; but what was there to do for a father? It was quite a
female case, and it would be very absurd for him, which could be without
to use at home, to lock in.His father very much wanted him to
meet Captain Wentworth, and there is no sufficient reason against
that he must go; and it ended with a bold and public release
declaration, on returning from the shoot, of his intention to dress
directly, and dine in the other house."Nothing can be better than the child," he said; "So I told my
father, later, that I would come, and he found me absolutely right.Your sister being with you, my love, I have no qualms.You
I wouldn't like to leave it on your own, but you see I can't be of any use.Anne will send me to find if there is anything."

Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be unsuccessful.Mary knew, as Charles spoke, that he was quite
determined to continue, and that it would be of no use to give him.It
So didn't say anything until he got out of the room, but as soon as
there was only Anne to hear ...

"So you and I have to be on our own, with this poor sick man
child; and not a creature that approaches us all evening! i knew how
it would be.It's always my chance.If there is anything
nasty men are always sure to get away with it, and Charles
is as bad as any of them.Very insensitive! I must say it is very
insensitive to him to run away from his poor little boy.Talk about
he is doing so well! How does he know he's okay
or that maybe there won't be a sudden change in half an hour? I do not have
I think Charles would have been so callous.So here he is to go
and have fun, and because I'm the poor mother, I don't have to be
left to stir; and yet I'm sure I'm more unfit than anyone else
be about the child.My being the mother is the very reason my
feelings shouldn't be tried.I am not at all the same.You have seen
how hysterical i was yesterday."

"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm, of the
shock.You won't be hysterical anymore.I dare say that we will have
nothing to distress us.I fully understand what Mr. Robinson said
directions, and have no fear; and indeed, Marie, I cannot be surprised to
your husband.Nursing does not belong to a man; it's not his
Province.A sick child is always the property of the mother: hers
feelings usually make it that way."

"I hope I love my child as much as any mother, but I don't know
I am no more useful in the sickroom than Charles, because I cannot be
always scolding and teasing the poor child when he is sick; and you saw,
this morning, that if I told him to shut up, he would surely start
hack.I don't have the nerves for the kind of thing."

"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to spend all the
evening away from the poor boy? "

"Yes, you see her daddy can, and why can't I? Jemima is so
meticulous; and she could tell us every hour how he was.I really have
thinks Charles might as well have told his dad we would all come.I
am no more alarmed by little Charles now than he is.I was
terribly alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different today."

"Well, if you don't think it's too late to warn you,
Suppose you go and your husband.Leave little Charles
to my care.Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove can't go wrong as long as I stay
with him."

"Are you serious?" cried Mary, her eyes lighting up."Dear me! It is
a very good thought, very good indeed.To be sure I might as well
go ahead like no, cause I'm no use around the house, am I? and it only harass me.You, who don't have the feelings of a mother, you are the cleanest
nobody.You can do anything to little Charles; he always thinks of you
one word.It will be much better than leaving him alone with
Jemima.Oh! I will definitely go; I'm sure I should if I can just like
as much as Charles, because they excessively want me to know
Captain Wentworth, and I know you don't mind being left alone.A
excellent thought of yours, indeed, Anne.I'm gonna go tell Charles,
and get ready directly.You can send us, you know, at some point
notice, if anything is the problem; but I dare say that there will be nothing
to alarm you.I shouldn't be going, you're sure if I didn't feel
completely at ease with my dear child."

The next moment she knocked on the door of her husband's lodge,
and as Anne followed her up the stairs, she was in time for everything
conversation, which began with the word of Mary, in a tone of great
exultation--

"I want to go with you, Charles, because I'm no more useful around the house than
you are.If I had to lock myself away with the child forever, I should
not being able to persuade him to do something he doesn't like.Anne goes
stay; Anne pledges to stay home and take care of him.It is
Anne's own proposal, and so I will go with you, which will be a great
do better, because I haven't had dinner in the other house since Tuesday."

“That's very nice of Anne,” was her husband's response, “and I should be
very happy to have you there; but it seems hard enough that it should be
left at home alone, to breastfeed our sick child."

Anne was now on hand to defend her own cause, and the sincerity of her
was soon enough to convince him, where the condemnation was at
less very pleasant, he no longer had any qualms about leaving her
dinner alone, even though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,
when the child could be resting for the night, and gently urged her to
for him to come and get her, but she wasn't convincing; and that
being the case, she soon had the pleasure of seeing them go
together in a good mood.They were gone, she hoped, to be happy,
strange as such happiness may seem; as for her,
she found herself with as many feelings of comfort as there may never have been
likely to be his.She knew she was of the first use in
child; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth was only a half
mile away, making himself agreeable to others?

She would have liked to know how he felt about a meeting.Perhaps
indifferent, if indifference could exist in such circumstances.He
must be indifferent or reluctant.Had he wished to see her one day
again, he didn't have to wait until this time; what would he have done
she could only believe that in her place she should have done a long time
not long ago, when events had given it early on this independence which alone
had wanted.Her brother and sister returned delighted with their new acquaintance,
and their visit in general.There had been music, singing, talking,
laughing, it was all very pleasant; captain's charming manners
Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they all seemed to know each other
perfectly, and he would come the next morning to shoot with
Charles.He was supposed to come to lunch, but not at the Cottage, however
that was originally proposed; but then he was in a hurry to come
at the big house instead, and he seemed to be afraid to be in Mrs.
The way of Charles Musgrove, because of the child, and therefore,
Somehow they barely knew how, it ended with Charles meeting him
lunch with his father.Anne got it.He wanted to avoid seeing her.he had inquired
after her she found, slightly, as might suit an old light
knowledge, seeming to recognize what she had recognized,
motivated, perhaps, by the same idea of ​​escaping the introduction when
had to meet.The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the
another house, and the next day the difference was so great that Mary
and Anne were only starting breakfast when Charles entered
to say that they were leaving, that he had come to pick up his dogs,
that his sisters followed with Captain Wentworth; her sisters
intends to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth proposes
also wait a few minutes if that is not bothersome; and although
Charles replied that the child was not in a state which
make it awkward, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without
its running on to give notice.Marie, very satisfied with this attention, was delighted to receive
him, while a thousand feelings rushed over Anne, of whom it was
most consoling, that it would soon be over.And it was soon over.In
two minutes after Charles' preparation, the others appeared; they were
in the living room.His eye half met Captain Wentworth's, a bow, a
the past reverence; she heard his voice; he talked to mary, said it all
was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves, enough to score an easy
foot; the room seemed full, full of people and voices, but a few
the minutes have finished it.Charles appeared at the window, everything was ready,
their visitor had bowed and gone, the Miss Musgroves were gone too,
suddenly resolved to walk to the end of the village with the
athletes: the room was clear, and Anne could finish her breakfast
as she could."It's over! It's over!" she repeated to herself over and over again,
nervous gratitude."The worst is over!"

Mary spoke, but could not attend.she had seen him.They had
meet.They had been in the same room once more.Soon, however, she began to reason with herself and try to feel
less.Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since everything had been
abandoned.How absurd it is to resume the agitation that such
the interval had been banished into the distance and the indistinct! What might not
eight years? Events of all kinds, changes, alienations,
moving - everything, everything must be included, and forgetting the past -
how natural, how sure too! He included almost a third of her
own life.Alas! with all her reasoning, she found that with lingering feelings
eight years maybe a little older than nothing.Now, how to read his feelings? Was it like wanting
Avoid it? And the next moment she hated herself for the madness
who asked the question.On another question that perhaps his greatest wisdom might not have
prevented, she was soon spared all suspense; because after the Miss
Musgroves had returned and had finished her visit to the Cottage she had
this spontaneous information from Mary: -

"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant to you, Anne, although he was.
listening to me.Henrietta asked him what he thought of you, when they
walked away, and he said, 'You were so thirsty he shouldn't have known
you again.'"

Mary had no feeling to make him respect her sister's in a common way,
but she had no idea at all that she was inflicting something special
injury."Modified beyond his knowledge."Anne submitted fully, silently, deeply
mortification.It was no doubt so, and she could not take revenge, for
it has not been tampered with, or not for the worse.She had already recognized
to herself, and she couldn't think differently, let him think about
her as he would.No: the years that had destroyed his youth and
bloom had only given him a brighter, more manly, open look, in no way
respect diminishing personal benefits.she had seen the same
Frédéric Wentworth."So thirsty he shouldn't have known her again!" They were words
who could only live with her.Yet she soon began to rejoice that
she had heard them.They were thought-provoking; they appeased
restlessness; they compose, and must therefore make her happier.Frederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them, but
without the idea that they would be carried around her.He had
thought she was miserably changed, and in the first moment of calling, had
spoke as he felt.He had not forgiven Anne Elliot.She had used it
sick, abandoned and disappointed; and worse, she had shown a
weakness of character in doing so, which his own decided, confident
the temper could not stand.She had abandoned him to oblige others.He
had been the effect of excessive persuasion.It had been weakness and
timidity.He had been very warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman
from whom he had believed her equal; but, with the exception of some natural
feeling of curiosity, he didn't want to see her again.Her
the power with him was gone forever.It was now her goal to get married.He was rich and excited
shore, entirely destined to settle as soon as it could be properly
attempted; really looking around ready to fall in love with all
speed that a clear head and a quick taste could allow.He had a heart
for either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart in
in short, for any pleasant young woman who would get in her way, with the exception of Anne
Elliot.It was his only secret exception, when he told his
sister, in response to her guesses: -

"Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a crazy match.Anybody
between fifteen and thirty can have me to ask.A little beauty,
and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy, and I'm a lost
man.Shouldn't that be enough for a sailor who hasn't had a company
among women to make him nice? "

He said it, she knew it, to be contradicted.His proud and shining eye spoke
the belief that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was not out of her
thoughts, when he more seriously described the woman, he should wish
meet."A strong mind, with gentle manners," said the first
and the last of the description."This is the woman I want", he said."Something a little lower I
will of course have to endure, but it doesn't have to be much.If I'm a fool
I will really be a fool, cause I have thought about this more than
most men."



Chapter 8


From that point on, Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were on several occasions in the
same circle.They were soon having dinner in company together at Mr
Musgrove, because the little boy's condition could no longer supply his aunt
with a pretext to be absent; And that was only the beginning
other meals and other meetings.The question of whether old feelings should be renewed must be
proof; old times are definitely to be remembered
each; they could only be restored; the year of their engagement
could only be named by him, in the little stories or descriptions
what conversation sparked.His profession qualified him, his
the disposition leads him to speak; and “It was in six years”; "This
happened before I set sail in six years, "took place during the course
of the first evening they spent together: and although his voice did not
weaken, and although she has no reason to assume that her eye is wandering
towards her as he spoke, Anne felt the total impossibility on his part
knowledge of his mind, that he might not be visited by memory
more than herself.There must be the same immediate association of
thought, although she was far from conceiving it as equal pain.They had no conversation together, no sex but what the
most common civility required.Once so for each other! Now nothing!
There was a time, when of all the great groups now filling the
Uppercross show, they would have had a hard time
stop talking to each other.With the possible exception of the admiral
and Mrs. Croft, who seemed particularly attached and happy, (Anne could
no other exception, even among married couples), it could
there haven't been two hearts so open, no tastes so similar
in unison, no faces so loved.Now they were like strangers;
no, worse than strangers, cause they could never get to know each other.He
was a perpetual estrangement.When he spoke, she heard the same voice, and saw the same spirit.There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the
Party; and he was questioned a lot, and especially by the two Miss
Musgroves, who seemed to have eyes only for himself, as for the
lifestyle on board, daily regulations, food, schedules, etc.., and
their surprise at his accounts, to learn the degree of accommodation
and the arrangement which was practicable, derived from it some joking
ridiculous, which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been
ignorant, and she too had been accused of assuming that the sailors
living on board with nothing to eat, nor any cook to dress her though
there was, or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.After listening and thinking thus, she was awakened by a whisper from Mrs.
Musgrove who, overwhelmed by tender regrets, could not help saying:

“Ah! Miss Anne, if it had rained in Heaven to spare my poor son, I dare
say he would've been just such another at this point."

Anne suppressed a smile and listened kindly, while Mrs. Musgrove
relieved his heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,
couldn't keep pace with other people's conversation.When she was able to let her attention return to its natural course, she
found the Miss Musgroves fetching the Navy List (their own Navy
list, the first ever to be at Uppercross), and sit down
together to examine it, with the professed vision of discovering the
ships commanded by Captain Wentworth."Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will be looking for the Asp."

"You won't find her there.Pretty worn and broken.i was the
last man who ordered him.Barely fit for service then.Adjustment reported
for home service for a year or two, so I was sent out West
India."

The girls looked surprised."The Admiralty," he continued, "amused itself from time to time, with
send a few hundred men out to sea, in a ship not suitable for the job.But they have a lot to provide; and among the thousands who
may as well go to the bottom or not, it is impossible for them to
distinguish the very set that may be the least missed."

"Phoo! Phoo!" cried the admiral, what are these young people saying!
Never was a better sloop than the Asp in its time.For an old building
sloop, you wouldn't see her equal.Lucky to have it! He knows
there must have been twenty men better than him who applied for her at
the same time.Lucky to have something so soon, nothing more
interest than his."

“I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you; replied Captain Wentworth,
seriously."I was as happy with my date as you can get
desire.It was a great object for me at that time to be at sea; a
very large object, I wanted to do something."

"To be sure you did.Why should a young man like you be on the ground
six months together? If a man had no wife he soon wants to be
again afloat."

"But, Captain Wentworth," cried Louisa, "how annoyed you must have been
when you came to Asp, to see what an old thing they gave you."

"I knew pretty well what she was before that day;" he said smiling."I had no more discoveries to make than you would have on the
the fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen loaned
among half of your acquaintance since you can remember it, and who
well, on a very humid day, lends itself to yourself.Ah! she was a dear
old Asp for me.She did everything I wanted.I knew she would.I knew
that we either had to get to the bottom together or that she would be
making me; and i never had two bad weather days all the time
I was at sea in her; and after taking enough corsairs to be very
entertaining, I had the chance to return home next fall,
fall with the very French frigate that I wanted.I brought her in
Plymouth; and here another example of luck.We hadn't been six o'clock
in the Sound, when a gale occurred, which lasted four days and four nights,
and who would have done for poor old Asp in half the time; our touch
with the Great Nation not having much improved our condition.Twenty-four hours later, and I should've been just a gallant
Captain Wentworth, in a little paragraph in the corner of the
newspapers; and only getting lost in a sloop, no one would have thought
on me.“Anne's shivers were for her alone; but the Miss
The Musgroves could be as open as they were sincere, in their exclamations
of pity and horror.“So what, I guess,” Mrs. Musgrove said, in a low voice, as if
thinking aloud, "then he went to Laconia, and there he met
with our poor boy.Charles, my dear ", (gesturing to him)," asks
Captain Wentworth where he first met your poor brother.I
always forgotten."

"It was in Gibraltar, mom, I know.Dick had remained ill at
Gibraltar, with a recommendation from its former captain to the captain
Wentworth."

" Oh ! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid of
mentioning poor Dick before me, as it would be rather a pleasure to
to hear about him from such a good friend."

Charles, being a little more attentive to the probabilities of the affair,
only nodded in response, and walked away.The girls were now hunting for Laconia; and Captain Wentworth could
do not deprive yourself of the pleasure of taking the precious volume in your
their own hands to keep them out of trouble, and once again read aloud the little one
the declaration of his name and rate, and the current class of the non-commissioned member,
observing that she too had been one of man's best friends
never had.“Ah! They were pleasant days when I had Laconia!
money in her.A friend of mine and I had such a great cruise together
off the western islands.Poor Harville, sister! You know how much he
wanted money: worse than me.He had a wife.Excellent comrade.I
will never forget his happiness.He felt it all, so much for her
Sake.I wished it again the following summer, when I still had the
same luck in the Mediterranean."

“And I'm sure, sir,” said Mrs. Musgrove, “it was a lucky day for us,
when you were appointed captain in this ship.We will never forget this
You did it."

Her feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth, hearing only
gone, and probably not having Dick Musgrove near his thoughts at all,
looked rather suspended, and as if he expected more."My brother," whispered one of the girls; "mom thinks of the poor
Richard."

“Poor dear comrade! continued Mrs. Musgrove; "he grew up so steadily,
and such an excellent correspondent, while he was in your care! Ah!
it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you.I assure you
you, captain Wentworth, we are so sorry he left you."

There was a momentary expression on Captain Wentworth's face at this
speech, a certain gaze from her shining eye, and curl from her beau
mouth, which convinced Anne, that instead of sharing with Mrs. Musgrove
good wishes, as for his son, he had probably struggled to get
get rid of him; but it was too fleeting an indulgence of self-amusement to
be detected by anyone who understands it less than themselves; in other
moment when he was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly
then climbing onto the couch, on which she and Mrs. Musgrove were
sat down, took a seat next to him and started a conversation with
she, in a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy and
natural grace, as shown by the kindest consideration for all that was
real and not absurd in the feelings of the parent.They were in fact on the same sofa, as Mrs. Musgrove had more easily
make room for him; they were only divided by Mrs. Musgrove.It was no
insignificant barrier, indeed.Mrs. Musgrove was comfortable,
substantial size, infinitely more apt by nature to express the good
joy and good humor, as tenderness and feeling; and while the
the agitations of Anne's slender form and thoughtful face can be envisioned
as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed to
credit for the self-control with which he took care of his big fat
sighs over the fate of a son, whom no one alive took care of.Personal size and mental grief certainly don't need to be
proportions.A big voluminous figure has the right to be
affliction, as the most gracious set of members in the world.But just
or not right, there are unseemly conjunctions, that the reason
condescension in vain - that taste cannot tolerate - what ridiculous
seize.Admiral, after taking a couple of refreshing turns around the room
hands behind him, called to order by his wife, has now come
up to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation of what he might
being interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts, began with -

"If you had been to Lisbon a week later, last spring, Frédéric, you
would have been invited to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her
girls."

"Should I? I'm glad I wasn't a week later then."

The admiral mistreated him for his lack of gallantry.He defended himself;
while professing that he would never willingly admit any woman on
board one of its ships, except for a ball or a visit, some of which
hours could understand."But, if I know myself," he said, "it's for lack of gallantry
towards them.It's rather to feel how impossible it is, with all
his efforts, and all his sacrifices, to make the accommodations on
board of directors such as women should have.He cannot lack gallantry,
Admiral, assessing the pretensions of women to each high personal comfort,
and that's what i do.I hate to hear about women on board, or to see
them on board; and no ship under my command will ever carry a family
ladies anywhere, if I can help it."

It brought his sister on top of him."Oh! Frederic! But I can't believe it from you.--All inactive
refinement! - Women can be as comfortable on board as in the best house
In England.I believe I have lived on board as much as most women, and
I don't know anything better than hosting a man of war.I
declare that I have no comfort or indulgence towards myself, even to
Kellynch Hall, "(with a kind greeting to Anne)," beyond what I've always had in
most of the ships I have lived in; and they were five in all."

"Nothing by the way," his brother replied.."You lived with
your husband, and were the only woman on board."

"But you, yourself, brought Mrs. Harville, her sister, her cousin and
three children, from Portsmouth to Plymouth.Where was it
A kind of superfine and extraordinary gallantry of yours then? "

"Everything merges in my friendship, Sophia.I would help any brother
the officer's wife I could, and I would bring anything from Harville
from the end of the world, if he wanted.But don't imagine that I made it
not to feel it as an evil in itself."

"Depend on it, they were all perfectly at ease."

"I might not like them better for that maybe.Such a number of
women and children are not allowed to be comfortable on board."

"My dear Frédéric, you talk quite idly.Pray, what would be
let us become poor sailors' wives, who often want to be transmitted to a
port or whatever, after our husbands, if everyone had your feelings? "

"My feelings, you see, did not prevent me from taking Mrs. Harville and all
his family in Plymouth."

"But I hate to hear you talk like a good gentleman, and like
women were all beautiful ladies, instead of rational creatures.We none of
we expect to be in fresh water everyday."

"Ah! My dear," said the admiral, "when he has had a wife he will sing
look different.When he's married, if we're lucky enough to live
to another war we will see him do like you and me, and many
others have done.We will have it very grateful to all those who
will bring his wife to him."

"Yes, that we are going."

"Now I am done," cried Captain Wentworth.."When once people get married
start attacking me with, - 'Oh! you will think very differently, when
you are married.“I can only say, 'No, I won't'; and then they say
again, `` Yes you will '', and there is an end."

He got up and walked away."What a great traveler you must have been, ma'am! said Mrs Musgrove
to Mrs. Croft.“Quite well, madame in the fifteen years of my marriage; although a lot
women did more.I have crossed the Atlantic four times and have
been to the East Indies once, and back, and only once; outraged
be in different places of the house: Cork, Lisbon and Gibraltar.But I've never been beyond the streets, and I've never been out west
India.We don't call Bermuda or the Bahamas, you know, the West Indies."

Mrs. Musgrove didn't have a say in disagreement; she couldn't accuse
herself for never having called them anything during her
life."And I assure you, ma'am," continued Mrs. Croft, "that nothing can
go beyond the accommodation of a man of war; I'm talking about, you know, the
higher rates.When you arrive on a frigate, of course you are more
confined; although any reasonable woman can be perfectly happy in any of the
them; and i can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been
spent on board a ship.While we were together you know there was
nothing to fear.Thank God! I have always been blessed with
excellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.A little
always disorderly the first twenty-four hours of departure at sea, but
never knew what illness was after.The only time I really
suffered in body or mind, the only time I ever imagined myself
ill, or I had ideas of danger, it was the winter that I spent
myself in Deal, when Admiral (Captain Croft at the time) was in the North
Seas.I lived in perpetual fear at that time, and I had all kinds of
imaginary complaints of not knowing what to do with myself, or when I
should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together nothing
never hurt me, and I never encountered the slightest inconvenience."

"Yes, to be sure.Yes indeed, oh yes! I totally agree with you,
Mrs. Croft ", was the warm response from Mrs. Musgrove.."There is nothing so bad
as separation.I totally agree with you.I know what it is because
Mr. Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so happy when they are
finished, and it's back to safety."

The evening ended with dancing.On her proposal, Anne offered
his services, as usual; and although his eyes sometimes fill with
tears as she sat in front of the instrument, she was extremely happy to be
employee, and wanted nothing in return but to be unnoticed.It was a joyous and joyous holiday, and no one seemed more spiritual than
Captain Wentworth.She felt he had everything to raise her
which general attention and deference, and in particular the attention of
all young women could do.The Miss Hayters, the females of the
family of cousins ​​already mentioned, have apparently been admitted to the
the honor of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa, they
both seemed so completely occupied with him, that nothing but the
the appearance of the most perfect benevolence between them could have
made it credible that they were not determined rivals.If he was a
little spoiled by such universal admiration, so ardent, which could
wonder?

These were some of the thoughts that occupied Anne as her fingers
were mechanically at work, proceeding together for half an hour,
also without error and without conscience.Once she felt this
he looked at himself, observing his changed features, perhaps,
trying to trace in them the ruins of the face that had once charmed
him; and once she knew he must have talked about her; she was barely
aware, until she hears the answer; but then she was sure of hers
asking her partner if Miss Elliot had never danced? The answer
was, “Oh, no; never ; she has completely given up dancing.Rather she had
to play.She never gets tired of playing."Once too he spoke to her.She had left the instrument on the dance being over, and he had sat down
to try to guess a look he wanted to give to the Miss
Musgroves an idea of.Unintentionally, she returned to that part of the
bedroom; he saw her, and, rising immediately, said with studied politeness:

“I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat; and although she
immediately backed down with a decided negative, it was not to be induced
sit down.Anne did not wish for more such looks and speeches.Its cold
politeness, his ceremonial grace, was worse than anything.Chapter 9


Captain Wentworth had come to Kellynch as to a house, to stay there as long as
he loved, being also completely the object of the admiral's brotherhood
the kindness of his wife.He had intended, upon his arrival, to
to go very soon to Shropshire, and visit the brother who has settled in
this country, but the attractions of Uppercross prompted it to put
disabled.There was so much friendship, flattery and
all that is most bewitching in its reception; the old people were so
hospitable, the young man so pleasant, that he could only resolve to
stay where he was, and take all the charms and perfections of
Edward's wife on credit a little longer.It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day.Musgroves could
hardly more willing to invite than to come, especially in the
morning, when he had no companion at home, for the admiral and Mrs.
Croft were generally out together, taking an interest in
their new possessions, their grass and their sheep, and stroll
in an unbearable way to a third person, or while driving into a concert,
recently added to their establishment.Until now, there had been only one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the
Musgroves and their addictions.It was a constant and warm admiration
all over; but this intimate foot was not more than established,
when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them, to be a good deal
disturbed by this, and to think that Captain Wentworth bothers a lot.Charles Hayter was the oldest of all cousins, and a very amiable,
pleasant young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been a
considerable appearance of attachment before Captain Wentworth
introduction.He was in charge; and having a curate in the
neighborhood, where residence was not required, lived with his father
house, just two miles from Uppercross.A short absence from home had
left his beautiful unguarded by his attentions at this critical period,
and when he returned he had the pain of finding very altered ways,
and see Captain Wentworth.Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.They each had money, but
their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of
result.Mr. Hayter had his own property, but it was
insignificant compared to that of Mr. Musgrove; and while the Musgroves were
in the first class of the society of the country, the young Hayters would be,
the inferior, retired and rude way of life of their parents,
and their own faulty upbringing, have hardly been in any class to
all, but for their connection to Uppercross, this eldest son of course
except, who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was
very superior in culture and manners to everything else.The two families had always been on excellent terms, for lack of
pride on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such
awareness of superiority among the Miss Musgroves, like the
happy to improve their cousins.Charles's attentions to Henrietta
had been observed by her father and mother without any disapproval."It wouldn't be a great game for her; but if Henrietta liked her," -
and Henrietta seemed to like it.Henrietta thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth arrived; But
from that moment cousin Charles had been much forgotten.Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was still
rather doubtful, as far as Anne's observation reaches.Henriette was
perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the highest spirits; and she didn't know
now, if the sweetest or the liveliest character was the most
likely to attract him.Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove, either to see little or to a whole
confidence in the discretion of their two daughters and all
the young people who approached them seemed to leave everything to take their
luck.There was not the slightest appearance of concern or remark
about them in the mansion; but it was different at the Cottage:
the young couple were more willing to speculate and marvel; and
Captain Wentworth hadn't been over four or five times in the Miss
Musgroves' company and Charles Hayter had just reappeared, when
Anne had to listen to her brother and sister's opinions on
who was the one who liked best.Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for
Henrietta, but strongly agree that getting him married could be
extremely delicious.Charles “had never seen a nicer man in his life; and from what he
had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure he had
not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.here is a
fortune at the same time; furthermore, there would be the chance of which could
to be made in any future war; and he was sure that Captain Wentworth was also
probably a man to distinguish himself like any naval officer.Oh! he
would be a crucial match for either of her sisters."

"At my word he would," replied Mary.."Dear me! If he had to get up
great honors! If he should ever be made a baronet! 'Lady
Wentworth 'sounds great.It would be a noble thing, indeed, to
Henriette! She would replace me then, and Henrietta would not
do not like it.Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth! It would only be a new one
creation, however, and I never think much of your new creations."

It was better for Marie to think that Henrietta was the one he liked the most.
story of Charles Hayter, whose claims she wished to see
end at.She looked down at the Hayters, and thought
it would be a shame to have the link between
families have been renewed - very sad for her and her children."You know," she said, "I can't think of it as a worthy match at all.
Henriette; and given the alliances that the Musgroves have made,
she does not have the right to throw herself.I don't think a young woman
has the right to make a choice which may be unpleasant and inconvenient
to the main part of his family, and have a bad relationship with
those who are not used to it.And, pray, who is Charles
Hayter? Nothing but a country priest.A most inappropriate match for Miss
Uppercross Musgrove."

Her husband, however, would not agree with her here; because in addition to having
respect for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son, and he saw
things as the eldest son himself."Now you're talking nonsense, Mary," was her response.."He
wouldn't be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has a really good
chance, through the Spicers, to get something from the bishop in
the course of a year or two; and you will remember it
is the eldest son; every time my uncle dies he walks into a very pretty
property.The domain of Winthrop is not less than two hundred and
fifty acres, in addition to the farm near Taunton, which is one of the best
land in the countryside.I grant you that any of them except Charles would
be a very shocking match for Henrietta, and indeed it couldn't be; he
is the only one that might be possible; but he is a very good child,
good kind of comrade; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands, he
will make it kind of a different place, and live in a very different place
sort of way; and with this property he will never be a contemptible
man - good freehold property.No no; Henrietta could do worse than
marry Charles Hayter; and if she has it, and Louisa can have the captain
Wentworth, I will be very satisfied."

"Charles can say whatever he wants," cried Marie to Anne, as soon as he
was out of the room, "but it would be shocking to see Henrietta get married
Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and even worse for me; and
it is therefore to be hoped that Captain Wentworth will soon be able to
put it quite out of his head, and I have little doubt that he
possesses.She paid little attention to Charles Hayter yesterday.I wish
you were there to see his behavior.And as for Captain Wentworth
to love Louisa as well as Henriette, it is nonsense to say it; For him
certainly love Henrietta very much the best.But Charles is so
positive! I wish you were with us yesterday, cause then you could
have decided between us; and I'm sure you would have thought like me,
unless you were determined to give it against me."

A dinner at Mr. Musgrove's house had been the occasion when all these things
should have been seen by Anne; but she had stayed at home, under the
mixed plea of ​​a headache and a return of indisposition
in little Charles.She had only thought of avoiding Captain Wentworth;
but an escape from being called as a referee has now been added to the
benefits of a quiet evening.As for Captain Wentworth's opinion, she considered more important than
he should know his own mind early enough not to endanger the
the happiness of one or the other of his sisters, or to indict his own honor,
should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.Either of the
they would, in all probability, make him a loving and good-humored man
wife.As for Charles Hayter, she had a delicacy which must be
pained by any frivolity of conduct in a well-meaning young woman, and a
heart to sympathize in one of the sufferings it caused; but if
Henrietta found herself in error as to the nature of her feelings, the
the alteration could not be understood too early.Charles Hayter had encountered many things to worry and mortify him in his
cousin behavior.She had too old esteem for him to be so completely
confused as much as possible in two meetings extinguishes all hopes of the past, and
leave him nothing else to do but stay away from Uppercross: but there
was such a change which became very alarming, when a man like the captain
Wentworth was to be considered the probable cause.He had been absent
only two Sundays, and when they broke up, had left her interested, even
at the height of his desires, in his prospect of soon leaving his
current curate, and get Uppercross instead.He had then
seemed the object closest to his heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who
for more than forty years zealously carried out all the tasks
of his office, but which was now becoming too crippled for many of them, should
be completely determined to hire a pastor; should make her curious as well
as good as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise to
he.The advantage of only having to come to Uppercross, instead of
go six miles another way; to have, in all respects, a better
curatorship; of belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr
Shirley is relieved of the duty he couldn't get anymore
without the most harmful fatigue, had been much, even for
Louisa, but had been almost everything for Henrietta.When he came
back, alas! the zeal of the company had passed.Louisa could not
not listening at all to his account of a conversation he had just had
with Dr Shirley: she was at a window, looking for the captain
Wentworth; and even Henrietta had at best only a shared attention on
give, and seemed to have forgotten all the previous doubt and concern
negotiation.“Well, I am very happy indeed: but I always thought you would have it;
I always thought you were sure.It didn't seem to me that, in short, you
know, Dr Shirley must have a pastor, and you got his promise.Is he coming, Louisa? "

One morning, very shortly after dinner at the Musgroves, to which Anne
had not been present, Captain Wentworth entered the salon at
the Cottage, where she and the invalid little Charles were,
who was lying on the sofa.The surprise of being almost alone with Anne Elliot, private
his manner of their usual calm: he jumped, and could not but say,
"I thought Miss Musgrove had come here: Mrs. Musgrove told me that I
should find them here, "before heading to the window to remember
himself, and feel how he should behave."They are upstairs with my sister: they will be downstairs in a few
moments, I dare say it, ”had been Anne's response, in all the confusion that
was natural; and if the child hadn't called her to come and do
something for him, she would have been out of the room the next moment,
and freed Captain Wentworth as well as herself.He continued to the window; and after having said calmly and politely: "I
I hope the little boy is better ", was silent.She was forced to kneel by the sofa and stay there to satisfy
his patient; and so they continued for a few minutes, when, to her very
great satisfaction, she heard another person cross the small
vestibule.She hoped, turning her head, to see the master of the
to house; but it turned out to be much less calculated to get things right
easy - Charles Hayter, probably not at all happier with the sight
of Captain Wentworth that Captain Wentworth had not seen
Anne.She only tried to say, “How are you? Don't you sit down? The
others will be here now."

Captain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently not
ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to
his attempts by sitting down near the table and taking the
newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.Another minute brought another addition.The youngest, a remarkable
fat child and before, two years old, having opened the door to
him by someone from outside, made his determined appearance among them, and
went straight to the couch to see what was going on, and put his
pretend to all that could be good.Having nothing to eat, he could only play; and like his
aunt didn't want to let him tease her sick brother he started to tie up
himself on top of her, as she knelt, in such a way that, busy as she was
about charles she couldn't shake him.She spoke to him, ordered,
begged and insisted in vain.Once she manages to push him
far away, but the boy had the greatest pleasure in riding on his back
still directly."Walter," she said, "get off this moment.You are extremely
embarrassing.I'm really mad at you."

“Walter,” cried Charles Hayter, “why don't you do what you're bidding on?
can't you hear your aunt talking Come to me, Walter, come to the cousin
Charles."

But Walter didn't stir at all.At another point, however, she found herself in a state of being
freed from him; someone took it away from him, although he bent
so much in his head that his sturdy little hands came loose
around her neck, and it was decidedly carried away, before she knew
that Captain Wentworth had done.Her feelings of discovery made her perfectly speechless.It
couldn't even thank him.She could only hang little Charles,
with the most messy feelings.His kindness to come forward to her
the relief, the manner, the silence in which he had passed, the little
details of the circumstance, with the condemnation soon forced upon it
by the noise he made studiously with the child, whom he heard
avoid hearing him thank him, and instead sought to testify that his
conversation was the last of his needs, produced such confusion of
variable agitation, but very painful, as she could not recover,
until the entrance of Marie and Miss Musgroves allows to do
on his little patient in their care, and leaves the room.She could
not stay.It was perhaps the occasion to observe the loves and
the jealousies of the four, they were now quite; but she could stay
for none of that.It was obvious that Charles Hayter was not doing well
tilted towards Captain Wentworth.She had a strong impression of his
having said, in an annoyed tone, after the intervention of Captain Wentworth
interference, "You should have cared about myself, Walter; I told you not to
Teaze your aunt; "and could understand his regret that the captain
Wentworth should do what he should have done himself.But neither
Charles Hayter's feelings, nor those of anyone, could not interest him,
until she had arranged hers a little better.She was ashamed of
herself, very ashamed to be so nervous, so overwhelmed by such
trifle; but it was so, and it took a long application of solitude
and reflection to recover it.Chapter 10


Other opportunities to make his observations could not fail to present themselves..Anne had soon been quite often in the company of the four together
to have an opinion, although too wise to admit it at home,
where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife; for
while she regarded Louisa as rather the favorite, she could not
but think, as much as she would dare to judge from memory and
experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love either.They
were more in love with him; yet this was not love.It was a little
fever of admiration; but he could, probably must, end in love with
some.Charles Hayter seemed aware of being despised, and yet Henrietta
sometimes seemed to be shared between them.Anne wanted
the power to represent to them all that they were, and to
highlighting some of the evils to which they exposed themselves.It
did not attribute any cunning to any.It was the greatest satisfaction for her
believe that Captain Wentworth was not at all aware of the pain he was feeling
occasioning.There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph in his way.He had probably never heard or thought of any allegations of
Charles Hayter.He was only wrong to accept the attentions (because
accept must be the word) of two young women at the same time.After a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter appeared to leave the
field.Three days had passed without his ever coming to Uppercross; a
most decided change.He had even refused a regular invitation to
having dinner; and having been found on occasion by Mr. Musgrove with some
large books in front of him, Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove were sure that not everything could be
right, and spoke, with grave faces, of his study to death.It was Mary's hope and belief that he had received a positive termination
Henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence of
see him tomorrow.Anne could only sense that Charles Hayter was
wise.One morning, around this time, Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth
to have gone to shoot together, as the sisters of the Cottage were
sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window by the sisters
from the mansion.It was a very beautiful day in November, and the Miss Musgroves passed
small lots, and stopped for nothing more than to say, that
they were going for a long walk and therefore concluded that Mary could
don't like to go with them; and when Mary immediately responded, with a few
jealousy of not being meant to be a good walker, "Oh, yes I would
to join you very much, I really like long walks; »Anne felt
convinced, by the looks of the two girls, that this was precisely what
they didn't want, and still admired the kind of necessity that the
family habits seemed to produce, of all
communicated, and everything to be done together, however
unwanted and impractical.She tried to talk Mary out of going, but
in vain; and that being the case, I thought it was better to accept the Miss
Musgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to do the same, as
she could be useful to turn around with her sister and reduce the
interference in any plan on their own."I can't imagine why they should assume that I shouldn't like a long
walk, said Mary walking up the stairs."Everyone is still
assuming I'm not a good walker; and yet they would not have been
happy, if we had refused to join them.When people walk into this
express way of asking ourselves, how can we say no? "

When it was time to leave, the gentlemen came back.They had taken
a young dog, who had spoiled their sport, and sent them away early.So their time, their strength and their spirit were exactly ready
for this walk, and they entered it with pleasure.Would Anne have
foreseen such a junction, she would have stayed at home; but, of some
feelings of interest and curiosity, she now believed that was too much
late to retract, and the entire six set off together in the
direction chosen by Miss Musgroves, who evidently considered the
walk as under their direction.Anne's goal was not to bother anyone; and where the
narrow paths through the fields necessitated many separations, to
with his brother and sister.His pleasure of the walk must come from
exercise and day, from the perspective of the last smiles of the year
on tawny leaves, and faded hedges, and to repeat to
itself some of the thousand existing poetic descriptions of
autumn, this season of special and inexhaustible influence on the mind
of taste and tenderness, this season which had drawn from all the poets,
worthy of reading, some attempt at description, or a few lines of
feeling.She occupied her mind as much as possible in things like
thoughts and quotes; but it was not possible, that when at hand
from Captain Wentworth's conversation with one of the Miss Musgroves,
she shouldn't try to hear it; yet she took little very remarkable thing.It was a simple lively conversation, like any young person, on an intimate
foot, could fall in.He was more engaged with Louisa than with
Henrietta.Louisa certainly put more forward for her opinion than she
sister.This distinction seemed to increase, and there was a
Louisa speech that hit her.After one of the many praises of
the day, which broke continuously, Captain Wentworth
added: -

“What a glorious time for the admiral and my sister!
take a long drive this morning; maybe we can greet them from some of
these hills.They talked about coming to this side of the country.I
I wonder where they will upset today.Oh! it happens very
often, I assure you; but my sister does nothing; she would do it like
to be cast as no."

“Ah! You take advantage of it, I know, "cried Louisa," but if it was
really, i should do the same for him.If I loved a man
as she loves the admiral, i will always be with him, nothing should
never separate us, and I'd rather be knocked down by him, rather than pushed
safely by someone else."

It was spoken with enthusiasm."Do you have?" he cried, taking the same tone; "I honor you!" And there
There was silence between them for a little while.Anne couldn't immediately fall back into a quote.The sweet
autumn scenes passed for some time, unless some tender sonnet,
charged with the appropriate analogy of the year in decline, with the decline
happiness, and the images of youth and hope and spring, it's all gone
together blessed his memory.She woke up to say, as they
struck by order in another way: "Isn't that one of the ways of
Winthrop? ”But no one heard, or at least no one answered him.Winthrop, however, or its environs - for young men are sometimes
they met, walking near their homes, was their destination; and after
another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures, where the
plows at work, and the freshly prepared path allowed the farmer to counter
the sweetness of poetic discouragement, and the sense of resuscitation,
they reached the top of the most considerable hill, which separated
Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon ordered a full view of the latter,
at the foot of the hill on the other side.Winthrop, without beauty and dignity, was stretched out before them;
an indifferent house, low, and surrounded by barns and
farmyard buildings.Mary exclaimed, “Bless me! Here is Winthrop.I declare that I had no idea!
Well now I think we better turn around; I am excessively tired."

Henrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles walking
along any path, or leaning against any door, was ready to do like Mary
wish; but no! "said Charles Musgrove, and" No, no! "cried Louisa.
more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be discussing the
warmly matters.Charles, meanwhile, declared very resolutely his resolution
to call his aunt, now that he was so close; and of course,
although more scared, trying to get his wife to go too.But this
was one of the points on which the lady showed her strength; and when
he recommended the advantage of resting for a quarter of an hour at
Winthrop, as she felt so tired, she answered resolutely: "Oh no,
Indeed! going up that hill would hurt him more than any other
sitting down could do him good; »And, in short, his look and his manners
declared, that she was not going.After a small succession of this kind of debates and consultations,
it was settled between Charles and his two sisters, that he and
Henrietta would just have to come down for a few minutes to see their aunt and
cousins, while the rest of the party awaited them at the top of the
hill.Louisa seemed to be the main organizer of the plan; and, like her
went with them for a bit, down the hill, still talking to Henrietta,
Marie took the opportunity to look with contempt around her and say
to Captain Wentworth ...

“It's very unpleasant to have such connections! But, I assure you, I
I have never been in the house above twice in my life."

She received no other answer than an artificial and consenting smile,
followed by a contemptuous look, as he turned away, that Anne
knew perfectly well the meaning of.The front of the hill, where they stayed, was a happy place: Louisa
returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step
of a stile, was very well satisfied as long as the others all stood
about her; but when Louisa pulled Captain Wentworth away, to try
gleaning nuts from an adjoining hedge, and they were gone
degrees out of sight and noise, Mary was no longer happy; it
was arguing over her own seat, was sure Louisa had a much better
somewhere, and nothing could stop him from going looking for a
better too.She walked through the same door, but couldn't see them.Anne found a nice place for him, on a dry and sunny shore, under the
hedge, in which she did not doubt that they were still, somewhere
Or other.Mary sat down for a while, but it was wrong; she was
sure Louisa had found a better place elsewhere, and she would continue
until she catches up with her.Anne, very tired herself, was happy to sit down; and she very soon
heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge behind her, as if
going up along the kind of rough and wild channel,
center.They were talking as they approached.Louisa's voice was the
distinguished first.She seemed to be in the midst of some impatience
word.What Anne heard for the first time was ...

"And so I made him go.I couldn't stand her being scared
of the visit by such absurdities.What! would I be repelled from
do something that I had decided to do, and that I knew to be right,
by airs and interference from such a person or anyone I could
say? No, I have no idea how easily I can be persuaded.When I
made my decision, I made it; and Henrietta seemed quite to have
dialed his own to stop at Winthrop today; and yet she was so close
give up, out of absurd complacency! "

"Would she have turned around then, without you?"

"She would indeed be.I'm almost ashamed to say it."

"Happy for her to have a mind like yours at hand! After the clues
you gave earlier, which only confirmed my own observations, the last
once I was in the company of him, I didn't need to affect to have no
understanding what is going on.I see that more than a simple duty
the morning visit to your aunt was in question; and woe to him, and to her
also, when it comes to important things, when they are placed in
circumstances requiring courage and strength of mind, if it does not
resolution sufficient to withstand unnecessary interference in a trifle like this.Your sister is a lovable creature; but yours is the character of
decision and firmness, I see.If you like his behavior or his happiness,
infuse it with as much of your own mind as you can.But that, no
doubt, you always did.It is also the worst of evils
surrender and indecisive a character, that no influence on him can be
depended on.You are never sure that a good impression will last;
everyone can influence it.May those who would be happy be steadfast.Here is
a walnut, he said, grabbing one from an upper branch, to illustrate:
a beautiful shiny nut, which, endowed with an original force, has
survived all the storms of autumn.Not a puncture, not a weak point
all over.This nut, he continued with cheerful solemnity,
many of his brothers fell and were trampled on, is still
in possession of all the happiness that a nut can be supposed
able to."Then going back to her old serious tone -" My first
wish all those that interest me is that they be firm.Yes
Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in November of her life,
she will cherish all her current spirit powers."

He had done and remained unanswered.It would have surprised Anne if
Louisa could easily have responded to such a speech: words of such
interest, spoken with such serious warmth! She could imagine what
Louisa felt.For herself she was afraid to move, afraid to do it
being seen.While she stayed, a low holly bush protected
her, and they were moving forward.Before they're out of her hearing
however, Louisa spoke again.“Mary is pretty good-humored in a lot of ways,” she said; "but she does
sometimes provoke me excessively, by his absurdity and his pride - the Elliot
Pride.She has way too much Elliot pride.We are doing it
wish Charles had married Anne instead.I guess you know that
wanted to marry Anne? "

After a moment's pause, Captain Wentworth said:

"You mean she turned it down?"

" Oh ! Yes ; certainly."

"When did it happen?"

“I don't know exactly, because Henrietta and I were in school at the time;
but i believe about a year before he married mary.I wish she had
accepted it.We should all have liked him much better; and
mom and dad still think it was her great friend Lady Russell
do, which she did not do.They think Charles might not be learned and
bookish enough to please Lady Russell, and therefore she
persuaded Anne to refuse it."

The sounds were withdrawing, and Anne could no longer distinguish.Her own
emotions kept her still.She had a lot to recover, before
she could move.The proverbial fate of the listener was not absolutely
hers; she had heard no harm from herself, but she had heard a lot
a very painful importation.She saw how her own character was viewed
by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree of feeling
and curiosity about it in its own way which must give it an extreme
commotion.As soon as she could she went after Mary, and after finding and walking
back with her to their old post, by the amount, felt some comfort
in their whole group being immediately after collected, and once
more moving together.His spirits wanted solitude and silence
that only numbers could give.Charles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as one might suppose,
Charles Hayter with them.The details of the Anne case could not
to try to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem to admit to
perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawal on
gentleman's side, and an assignment from the lady, and that they were now
very happy to be together again, admitted no doubts.Henrietta
looked a little ashamed, but very happy; - Charles Hayter
extremely happy: and they were devoted to each other almost from the
first moment of their departure for Uppercross.Everything now pointed to Louisa for Captain Wentworth; nothing could
be clearer; and where many divisions were needed, or even where they
were not, they walked side by side almost as much as the other two.In
a long strip of meadow, where there was ample space for all, they
were thus divided, forming three distinct parties; and to this party of
the three who boasted the least animation and less complacency
necessarily belonged.She joined Charles and Mary, and was tired
enough to be very happy with Charles' other arm; but Charles, although
very good mood with her, was in a bad mood with his wife.Marie had
was disparaging to him, and now had to reap the consequences,
which had the consequence of dropping his arm almost every moment to cut
cut the heads of some nettles in the hedge with its switch; and when
Marie started to complain about it and to complain about being abused, according to
as usual, being on the side of the hedge, while Anne was never inconvenienced
on the other, he dropped the arms of both to chase a weasel that
he glanced momentarily at, and they could barely train him to
all.This long meadow bordered an alley, of which their path, at the end of
it was to be crossed, and when the whole group had reached the exit door,
the car moving in the same direction, which had been some time
heard, had just arrived, and turned out to be Admiral Croft's concert.He
and his wife had taken their planned car and were driving home.Hearing how long the young people had been on a march, they
kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired; he
would save her a mile and a half, and they were going through Uppercross.The invitation was general, and generally declined.The Miss Musgroves
were not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, because she was not
before any of the others, or what Louisa called Elliot's pride could
not bear to make a third in a chair on a horse.The walking group had crossed the alley and was overcoming a
opposite upright, and the admiral put his horse back in motion,
when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in an instant to say something
to his sister.The something could be guessed by its effects."Miss Elliot, I'm sure you're tired," cried Mrs. Croft.."Let us
looking forward to bringing you home.Here is a great part for
three, I assure you.If we were all like you I believe we could sit down
four.You must, indeed, you must."

Anne was still in the alley; and although instinctively begins to
refuse, she was not allowed to continue.The admiral's kind urgency
came to support his wife; they would not be refused; they or they
have compressed into the smallest possible space to leave it a
corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word, turned to her,
and quietly forced her to be assisted in the car.Yes; he had done it.She was in the car and felt he had
placed her there, that her will and her hands had made it, that she
owed it to his perception of his fatigue and his resolution to give
his rest.She was greatly affected by the sight of his disposition
towards her, which all these things made apparent.This little
circumstance seemed the completion of everything that had happened before.It
understood it.He couldn't forgive her, but he couldn't be
insensitive.Although condemning it for the past, and viewing it with
high and unfair resentment, though utterly reckless of her, and
while attaching himself to another, he still did not see her suffering,
without the desire to relieve her.It was a remnant of the old
feeling; it was a surge of pure friendship, though unrecognized;
it was a proof of her own warm and kind heart, that she could not
to contemplate without emotions so composed of pleasure and pain, that
she did not know what prevailed.His responses to the kindness and remarks of his companions were to
first given unconsciously.They had come halfway along the
rough way, before she was quite aware of what they were saying.Then she
found them talking about "Frederick."

"He sure wants to have either of these two girls, Sophy,"
said the admiral; "but there is no telling who.He ran
after them too, long enough, one might think, to decide.Ay, this comes from peace.If it was war now he would have settled down
long ago.We sailors, Miss Elliot, can't afford to do long
courtship displays in wartime.How many days are there, my dear, between
first time I see you and we sit together in our
accommodation in North Yarmouth? "

"We better not talk about it, my dear," replied Mrs. Croft,
pleasantly; "for if Miss Elliot heard how long we got to a
Understanding, she would never be convinced that we could be happy
together.I had known you by character, however, long before."

"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we
wait elsewhere? I don't like to have such things on my hands for so long.I wish Frederick would spread some more canvas and take us home
one of those young girls in Kellynch.So there would always be
company for them.And very nice young ladies they are both; I barely
know each other."

"Very good-humored and unaffected girls indeed," Ms. Croft said, in a
calmer tone of praise, as this made Anne suspect that her sharper powers
might not consider any of them to be quite worthy of their brother; "and
a very respectable family.We couldn't be connected with better
people.My dear admiral, this post! we will definitely take that
Publish."

But by coolly giving the reins a better direction themselves, they
past the danger; and turning it off judiciously once thereafter
by hand, they did not fall into a rut, nor did they escape from a manure cart; and
Anne, somewhat amused by their driving style that she imagined
no misrepresentation of the general direction of their affairs, found
herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage.Chapter 11


The time for Lady Russell's return was approaching: the day was even
fixed; and Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was
relocated, eagerly awaited a quick move to Kellynch, and
start to think about how much your own comfort might be affected.This would place her in the same village as Captain Wentworth, at
half a mile from it; they should attend the same church, and
there must be some relationship between the two families.It was against
her; but on the other hand he spent so much time at Uppercross,
that in removing from there, she might be considered rather as leaving him
behind, than by going towards him; and, overall, she believed
she must, on this interesting question, be the winner, almost too
certainly as in his change of domestic society, leaving poor Mary
for Lady Russell.She wished it was possible for her to avoid seeing the captain
Wentworth at the Hall: These rooms had witnessed ancient meetings that
would be brought too painfully before her; but she was even more anxious
for the possibility that Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth will never meet
all over.They didn't love each other, and no renewal of acquaintance
now could do any good; and if Lady Russell saw them together, she
might think he had too much composure, and she too little.These points formed his main concern to anticipate his distance.
Uppercross, where she felt like she had been in the job for quite a long time
sufficient.Its usefulness to little Charles would always give something
sweetness at the memory of his two-month stay there, but he was
regain her strength quickly, and she had nothing else to stay.The conclusion of his visit, however, was diverse in a way that
she had not imagined at all.Captain Wentworth, after being invisible and
unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, again appeared among them
to justify himself by a report of what had moved him away.A letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having discovered him at
finally, had provided information on the regulations of Captain Harville with
his family in Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore, quite
without knowing it, within twenty miles of each other.Captain Harville had
never been in good health since a serious injury from which he received two
years before, and Captain Wentworth's anguish at seeing him had determined
him to go immediately to Lyme.He had been there for twenty-four
hours.His acquittal was complete, his friendship warmly honored, a
keen excited interest in his friend, and his description of the fine
country about Lyme so warmly attended by the party, that a
sincere desire to see Lyme themselves, and a plan to go
was the consequence.The kids were all crazy to see Lyme.Captain Wentworth spoke
to return there himself, it was only seventeen miles
Uppercross; although in November the weather was by no means bad; and in
In short, Louisa, who was the most greedy of the greedy, having formed the
resolution to go, and in addition to the pleasure of doing what she wanted, to be
now armed with the idea of ​​merit to keep his own way,
all the wishes of his father and mother to put it off until the summer;
and to Lyme they had to go - Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta, Louisa,
and Captain Wentworth.The first carefree plan had been to go in the morning and come back to
night; but to this Mr. Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not
consent; and when it came to being considered rationally, one day in the
mid-November wouldn't leave much time to see a new place,
after deduction of seven hours, depending on the nature of the country, for
back and forth.They therefore had to spend the night there,
and not be expected until dinner the next day.It was felt
be a significant amendment; and although they all met at the Grand
Home at breakfast time quite early, and departure very punctual,
it was so past noon before the two cars, Mr Musgrove's coach
containing the four ladies, and Charles's program, in which he conducted
Captain Wentworth walked down the long hill to Lyme, and
entering the even steeper street of the city itself, that it was
very obvious that they would not have more than time to look around them,
before the light and heat of the day is gone.After finding accommodation and ordering dinner at one of the
hostels, the next thing to do was definitely to walk straight
until the sea.They came too late in the year to have fun
or variety that Lyme, as a public place, could offer.The rooms were
shut up, the tenants almost all gone, almost no family but
the residents are gone; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings
themselves, the remarkable location of the city, the main street
almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting around
the pleasant little bay, which, in season, is lively for swimming
machinery and business; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and its new
improvements, with the beautiful line of cliffs stretching
the east of the city is what the eye of the stranger will seek; and a very
strange stranger he must be, who sees no immediate charms
around Lyme, to make him want to get to know him better.The scenes in
its district, Charmouth, with its high grounds and vast
sweeping country, and even more, its sweet secluded bay, leaning against
dark cliffs, where fragments of low rocks among the sands, make it the
happiest place to watch the tide flow, to sit
carefree contemplation; the woody varieties of the happy village of
Up Lyme; and especially Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic
rocks, where scattered forest trees and orchards of
growth, state that many generations must have died since the
first partial fall from the cliff set the stage for such
state, where such a marvelous and beautiful scene is exhibited, as can
more than equal to any of the scenes that resemble the famous island of
Wight: these places must be visited, and visited again, to make
Lyme value included.The Uppercross group passing through the now deserted and
melancholy looking rooms, and always falling, soon found themselves
At the seaside ; and linger only, for all must linger and contemplate a
first return to the sea, which ever deserved to watch it,
walked towards the Cobb, also their object in itself and on
Captain Wentworth's story: because in a little house, near the foot of a
old jetty of unknown date, were the Harvilles.Captain
Wentworth turned to his friend; the others were walking, and he
was to join them on the Cobb.They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even
Louisa seemed to sense that they had long since separated from Captain Wentworth,
when they saw him coming after them, with three companions, all good
already known, by description, to be Captain and Mrs. Harville, and a
Captain Benwick, who was staying with them.Captain Benwick had been first lieutenant of Laconia some time ago;
and Captain Wentworth's account of him on his return
of Lyme before, his warm praise for him as an excellent young man and
an officer, whom he had always appreciated in high esteem, who must have had his stamp
well in the esteem of all listeners, had been followed by a small
the story of his private life, which made him perfectly interesting
in the eyes of all the ladies.He had been engaged to the captain
Harville's sister, and now mourning her loss.It had been a year
or two waiting for fortune and promotion.Fortune has come, his
the award as a lieutenant being awesome; promotion also came at last;
but Fanny Harville did not live to find out.She was dead the previous one
the summer while he was at sea.Captain Wentworth believed it was impossible
so that the man would be more attached to the woman than poor Benwick had been to
Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply grieved under the dreadful
change.He considered his disposition to be the kind that had to suffer
strongly, uniting very strong feelings with calm, seriousness and withdrawal
good manners, a strong taste for reading and sedentary activities.AT
end the interest of the story, the friendship between him and the
Harvilles seemed, if possible, augmented by the event that closed everything
their alliance views, and Captain Benwick was now living with them
entirely.Captain Harville had taken his present home for half a
year; his taste, and his health, and his fortune, all directing him to
a cheap residence by the sea; and the size of the
country, and the Lyme retreat in winter, appeared exactly
adapted to the state of mind of Captain Benwick.Sympathy and goodwill
excited towards captain benwick was very tall."And yet," Anne thought to herself, as they now moved forward to meet the
gone ", he may not have a more sorrowful heart than me.I
can't believe her outlook is so wasted forever.He is younger than
I am; younger, if not in fact; younger than a man.He will be
come together and be happy with one another."

They all met and were introduced.Captain Harville was a tall, dark
the man, with a sensitive and benevolent face; a little lame; and of
strong characteristics and lack of health, looking much older than the captain
Wentworth.Captain Benwick looked, and was, the youngest of the three,
and, compared to one or the other, a little man.He had a nice
face and a wistful look, as it should have, and withdrew from
conversation.Captain Harville, without equaling Captain Wentworth in his manners,
was a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm and helpful.Mrs Harville,
less polite than her husband, however seemed to have the
same good feelings; and nothing could be nicer than their
desire to consider the whole party as friends of their own, because
friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable than their
supplications for all by promising to dine with them.Dinner,
already ordered from the hostel, was eventually, albeit unintentionally, accepted
as an excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth
brought such a party to Lyme, without considering it a thing
of course they should have dinner with them.There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all of this, and such
a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so rare, so different
the usual style of give and take invitations and formal dinners
and display, which Anne felt her minds likely would not benefit from
growing knowledge among his brother officers."These would be
have been all my friends, ”she thought; and she had to fight
against a great tendency to meanness.Leaving the Cobb, they all entered their home with their new friends,
and I have found rooms as small as those that invite the heart
might think capable of accommodating so many.Anne had a moment
astonishment at the subject itself; but he was soon lost in the
nicer feelings that sprang from the sight of all the ingenious
the artifices and pretty arrangements of Captain Harville, for
real space for the best account, to fill the gaps in
residential furniture, and protect windows and doors against
winter storms to expect.Varieties in the development of
rooms, where the common necessities provided by the owner, in the
common indifferent fate, were contrasted with a few articles of a
rare wood species, excellently worked, and with something curious
and precious from all the distant lands that Captain Harville had
visited, were more than amusing for Anne; connected as everything was with
his profession, the fruit of his labors, the effect of his influence
on his habits, the image of rest and domestic happiness
presented, did something more, or less, than gratification.Captain Harville was not a reader; but he had succeeded in excellent
housings, and shaped with very pretty shelves, for a
collection of well-bound volumes, property of Captain Benwick.His
the lameness prevented him from getting much exercise; but a spirit of
utility and ingenuity seemed to provide him with constant employment
in.He drew, he varnished, he structured, he stuck; he was making toys
for kids; he made new needles and net pins with
improvements; and if all else was done, sit down in front of her big
fishing net in a corner of the room.Anne thought she had left great happiness behind when they left the
to house; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking, burst into
raptures of admiration and delight over the character of the navy; their
kindness, their brotherhood, their openness, their righteousness;
protesting that she was convinced that sailors were more valuable and
heat than any other group of men in England; that they only knew how
live, and they only deserved to be respected and loved.They returned to dress and dine; and so well the diagram had answered
already, that nothing has been found wrong; although it is "so entirely
off season ", and the" no Lyme street "and the" no
the expectation of society ”, had brought many excuses on the part of the heads of
the hostel.Anne found herself at that point becoming so much more hardened to be
in the company of Captain Wentworth that she had first imagined
never, than sitting at the same table with him now, and the
exchange of common courtesies that take part in it (they have never
beyond), had become a simple nothing.The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet until the next day,
but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening; and he
came, also bringing his friend, which was more than expected,
it being agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of
to be oppressed by the presence of so many foreigners.He ventured
among them still, however, although his minds certainly did not seem
worthy of the cheerfulness of the party in general.While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the speech from one side of the
room, and going back to ancient days, provided anecdotes in abundance
to occupy and entertain others, it was up to Anne to be placed
rather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impetus from him
nature forced her to get to know him.He was shy and
willing to abstraction; but the endearing softness of her face,
and the gentleness of his manners soon had their effect; and Anne was fine
reimbursed the first effort.He was evidently a young man from
considerable taste for reading, but mainly for poetry; and
besides the persuasion of having given him at least one evening
indulgence in the discussion of subjects, than his usual companions
probably had no worries, she hoped to be of real use to
him in some suggestions as to the duty and advantage of struggling
against the affliction, which had naturally arisen from their
conversation.Because, although shy, he did not seem reserved; rather he had
the appearance of happy feelings to burst their usual constraints; and
having spoken of poetry, of the wealth of the present day, and
by a brief comparison of opinions about first-rate poets,
trying to find out if Marmion or La Dame du Lac should be
favorite, and how classified the Giaour and the Bride of Abydos; and
moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced, it turned out thus
knowing intimately all the tenderest songs of a single poet, and
all the passionate descriptions of the desperate agony of the other; he
repeated, with such a trembling feeling, the various lines that imagined a
broken heart, or a mind destroyed by misery, and looked so
quite as if he wanted to be understood, that she dared to hope that he
didn't always read only poetry, and to say that she thought it was
the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely appreciated by those who
fully appreciated; and that strong feelings that alone could
feel that it was really the feelings that should taste him but
with parsimony.His gaze showed him no pain, but pleased with this allusion to his
situation, she is emboldened to continue; and feeling within herself the
seniority right, she ventured to recommend a greater
allocation of prose in his daily study; and on request from
to particularize, to mention such works of our best moralists, such
collections of the most beautiful letters, such memoirs of valuable characters
and suffering, as it occurred to him at this moment, as apt to awaken
and fortify the spirit by the highest and strongest precepts
examples of moral and religious endurance.Captain Benwick listened intently and looked grateful
implicit interest; and although with a nod, and sighs that
declared his little faith in the effectiveness of all books on bereavement as
hers, wrote down the names of those she recommended and promised to
get them and read them.When the evening was over, Anne could only have fun at the thought of
his coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man
that she had never seen before; she also couldn't help but fear, on more
serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists and
preachers, she had been eloquent on a point where her own conduct
would not stand the exam.Chapter 12


Anne and Henrietta, being the first of the party on
the next morning agreed to take a walk to the sea before breakfast.They
went to the sand, to watch the tide flow, which a fine
the south-easterly breeze brought with all the grandeur that
flat a shore allowed.They rented in the morning; glorified in the sea;
hit it off in the pleasure of the cool breeze - and were
quiet; until Henrietta suddenly started again with ...

"Oh! Yes, I am quite convinced that, with a few exceptions, the
the sea air is always good.There is no doubt that he was
greatest service to Dr Shirley after his illness last spring
year.He declares himself, that coming to Lyme for a month,
did him more good than all the drugs he took; and, this being by the
the sea, always makes him feel young.Now I can't help but think so
a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea.I think he had
better to leave Uppercross entirely and settle in Lyme.Isn't it, Anne?
Don't you agree with me that it's the best thing he can do, both
for him and Mrs. Shirley? She has cousins ​​here, you know, and a lot
knowledge, which would make her happy for her, and I'm sure she
would be happy to go to a place where she could have medical assistance
at hand, in case he has another seizure.Indeed I think so
quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley,
who have done good all their lives, wearing out their last days
in a place like Uppercross, where except for our family they seem closed
out of the world.I would like his friends to suggest it to him.I
really think they should.And, as for obtaining a dispensation, there
couldn't be difficult in his time in life, and with his character.My
the only doubt is whether something could persuade him to leave his parish.He is so strict and scrupulous in his notions; too scrupulous I
must say.Don't you think, Anne, that it's too scrupulous? Do not
you think it is a very wrong point of conscience, when a clergyman
sacrifices his health for homework, which can be just as good
played by another person? And in Lyme too, only seventeen miles
off, it would be close enough to hear, if people thought there was
anything to complain about."

Anne smiled to herself more than once during this speech, and entered
in the subject, as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of
a young woman like a young man, although here it was good from a lower
standard, for what could be offered if not a general acquiescence? She said
anything that was reasonable and suitable for the business; felt the claims of
Dr Shirley to rest as she should; seen how desirable it was that
he should have an active and respectable young man, as a resident
parish priest, and was even courteous enough to allude to the advantage of such
the resident vicar gets married."I wish," said Henrietta, very pleased with her companion, "I wish
Lady Russell lived in Uppercross and was intimate with Dr Shirley.I
I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence.
with everyone ! I still consider her capable of persuading a person to
whatever! I'm scared of her, like I told you before, scared enough
of her, because she is so very intelligent; but I respect her surprisingly, and
I wish I had such a neighbor in Uppercross."

Anne amused herself in Henrietta's way of being grateful, and amused herself
as well as the course of events and Henrietta's new interests
opinions should have placed her friend in favor of one of the
Musgrove family; she only had time, however, for a general response, and
a wish that such another woman would be at Uppercross, before all matters
suddenly ceased, seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards
them.They also came for a walk until breakfast was likely to be
ready; but Louisa remembering immediately afterwards that she had
something to get in a store, invited them all to come back with her
in the city.They were all at his disposal.When they got to the steps, leading up the beach, a
sir, at the same time preparing to descend, politely drew
back, and stopped to give way to them.They went up and passed him; and
as they passed, Anne's face caught his attention, and he looked at her with a
degree of sincere admiration, of which she could not be insensitive.She looked remarkably well; its very regular, very pretty
characteristics, having the flowering and freshness of youth restored by the fine
wind blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of
eye he had also produced.It was obvious that the gentleman,
(completely a gentleman) admired him excessively.Captain
Wentworth looked at her instantly in a way that showed him
to notice.He gave her a momentary look, a look of
shine, which seemed to say: "This man is struck by you, and even
I'm seeing something like Anne Elliot right now."

After dating Louisa through her business, and strolling on a
a little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, by the way
then quickly from his own bedroom to their dining room, had
almost ran against the same gentleman, as he came out of a
adjoining apartment.She had previously conjectured him to be a stranger
like themselves, and determined that a handsome groom, who was
walk near the two hostels on their return, should be his
servant.The master and the grieving man helped the idea.He
it was now proven that he belonged to the same inn as them; and that
second meeting, however short it may be, has also been proven by the
air, which he found his very beautiful, and by the eagerness and
convenience of his apologies, that he was an extremely good man
manners.He appeared to be about thirty years old, and although not handsome, had a
nice person.Anne felt she would like to know who he was.They had almost finished lunch, when the noise of a car, (almost
the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the group to
the window.It was a gentleman's car, a program, but that only came
round from the stable to the front door; someone has to go
a way.He was led by a grieving servant.The word curriculum blew up Charles Musgrove that he could compare
with his; the grieving servant aroused Anne's curiosity, and
the six were gathered to watch, by the time the owner of the
the program was to be seen coming out of the doorway amid the arches and
courtesies of the house, and to take his seat to leave."Ah!" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with a half-glance
Anne, "this is the very man we met."

The Miss Musgroves accepted it; and having all kindly looked at him as
far up the hill as they could they went back to the breakfast table.The waiter entered the room shortly after."Please," said Captain Wentworth immediately, "can you tell us the name?"
of the gentleman who has just left? "

"Yes, sir, a Mr. Elliot, a gentleman of great fortune, came last
sidmouth night.Dare to say that you heard the car, sir, while you
were at dinner; and now continues for Crewkherne, en route to Bath and
London."

“Elliot! Many had looked at each other, and many had repeated the
name, before it all happened, even by smart speed
a server."Bless me!" cried Mary; "It must be our cousin; it must be our Mr.
Elliot, it must, indeed! Charles, Anne, isn't it? In mourning, you
see, just like our Mr. Elliot must be.How truly extraordinary! In the
same hostel with us! Anne, shouldn't that be our Mr. Elliot? my
the next heir of the father? Please, sir, turning to the waiter, don't you
heard, didn't his servant say if he belonged to the Kellynch?
family?"

"No, ma'am, he didn't mention any particular family, but he said his
master was a very rich gentleman, and would one day be a baron."

"There! You see!" cried Mary in ecstasy, as I said! Heir to
Sir Walter Elliot! I was sure it would come out, if it did.Count it in, this is a circumstance that his servants take care of
publish, wherever he goes.But, Anne, only conceive of the extraordinary!
I wish I had watched it more.I wish we had known in time, who
it was, that he could have been presented to us.What a pity that we
should not have been introduced to each other! Do you think he had the
Elliot's face? I barely looked at him, I watched the
horses; but I think he had something of Elliot's face, I
I wonder if the arms have not hit me! Oh! the hood was hanging
the panel, and hid the arms, so he did; otherwise I'm sure I should
observed them, and the livery too; if the servant had not been in
in mourning, we should have known him by livery."

"Bringing together all these very extraordinary circumstances," said
Captain Wentworth, "we have to look at it as the arrangement of
Providence, that you shouldn't be introduced to your cousin."

When she could get Mary's attention, Anne gently tried to convince
her that their father and Mr. Elliot had not been, for many years,
terms such as the power to attempt an introduction
desirable.At the same time, however, it was a secret gratuity to herself.
saw his cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch was
definitely a gentleman, and had an air of common sense.She wouldn't,
in any case, mention that she met him for the second time;
fortunately, Marie did not take much care of their passage near him in
their previous walk, but it would have felt quite misused by Anne
having actually run against him in the passage, and received his very
a polite apology, when she had never been near him at all; not that
a little cousin interview must remain a perfect secret.“Of course,” said Mary, “you will mention that we saw Mr. Elliot, the
next time you write to Bath.I think my father should definitely hear
of it; mention everything about him."

Anne avoided a direct response, but it was just the circumstance that she
considered not only useless to communicate, but like what
should be deleted.The offense that had been inflicted on his father,
she knew it many years ago; Elizabeth's special part, she
suspected; and that Mr. Elliot's idea has always produced irritation in both
was beyond doubt.Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the work of
maintain a slow and unsatisfying correspondence with Elizabeth fell
on Anne.Breakfast hadn't been over for a long time, when they were joined by the captain and
Mrs. Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had designated to take
their last walk on Lyme.They should leave for
Uppercross by one, and meanwhile had to be all together, and
outside as long as they could.Anne found Captain Benwick approaching her, as soon as they were all
enough in the street.Their conversation the night before did not
do not look for it again; and they walked together for a while,
speaking as before of Mr. Scott and Lord Byron, and still as incapable as
before, and as incapable as two other readers, of thinking in exactly the same way
of the merits of one or the other, until something causes a
change among their group, and instead of Captain Benwick, she had
Captain Harville by his side."Miss Elliot," he said in a low voice, "you have done a good deed.
by making this poor boy talk so much.I wish he could have such
company often.It is bad for him, I know, to be silent as he is;
But what can we do? We can't part."

"No," said Anne, "that I can easily believe is impossible; but in
the weather, perhaps - we know what the weather does in each case of affliction, and
you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend can still be called
a young man in mourning - only last summer, I understand."

"Yes that's right," (with a deep sigh) "only June."

"And not known to him, maybe, so soon."

"Not until the first week of August, when he got back from Cape Town,
just turned into a Grappler.I was in Plymouth dreading to hear about
him; he sent letters, but the Grappler was under command of
Portsmouth.There, the news must follow him, but who will tell it?
not me.I would have immediately run to the arm of the court.Nobody could
do it, but this good guy '(pointing to Captain Wentworth.)  "The
Laconia had entered Plymouth the previous week; no danger that she is
sent to sea again.He took his chance for the rest; written for
leave, but without waiting for the return, traveled at night and
day until he gets to Portsmouth, rowed to the Grappler this instant,
and never left the poor boy for a week.That's what he did, and
no one else could have saved poor James.You may be thinking, Miss Elliot,
if it is dear to us! "

Anne considered the matter with a perfect decision and said the same.
in response that his own feeling could accomplish, or as hers seemed capable of
the bear, because he was too affected to renew the subject, and when he
spoke again, it was about something totally different.Mrs. Harville gives as an opinion that her husband would have
walking enough by the time he got home, determined the
leading the whole party in what was to be their last outing; they or they
walked them to their door, then came back and left
themselves.By all their calculations, it was just time for that;
but as they approached the Cobb there was such a general desire to walk
along this one again, all were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew up
determined, that the difference of a quarter of an hour it was found,
wouldn't make any difference; so with all the kind of leave, and
all the kind exchanges of invitations and promises that can be
imagined, they parted ways with the Captain and Mrs. Harville at their own doorstep,
and always accompanied by Captain Benwick, who seemed to cling to them
to the last, proceeded to bid the appropriate farewell to the Cobb.Anne found Captain Benwick approaching her.Lord Byron's "dark"
blue seas "could not fail to be highlighted by their present
seen, and she willingly gave him her full attention as long as the
was possible.It was soon drawn, necessarily in another way.It was too windy to make the upper part of the new Cobb pleasant
for the ladies, and they agreed to go down the steps to the bottom, and
all contented themselves to pass quietly and carefully along the steep flight,
with the exception of Louisa; she must be descended from them by Captain Wentworth.In all their walks, he must have skipped it from the uprights; the
the feeling was delicious to her.The hardness of the sidewalk for her
feet, made him less disposed on the present occasion; he did,
yet.She was safely down, and instantly, to show her joy,
ran the stairs to be back down.He advised against it,
found the pot too big; but no, he reasoned and spoke in vain, she
smiled and said, "I am determined to do this:" he stretched out his hands; it
was too rushed for half a second, she fell on the sidewalk on the
Lower Cobb, and was taken back lifeless! There was no wound, no blood,
no visible bruising; but her eyes were closed, she wasn't breathing, her face
was like death.The horror of the moment for all who stood there!

Captain Wentworth, who had caught her, knelt with her in his arms,
looking at her with a face as pale as hers, in agony of
silence." She is dead ! She is dead ! yelled Mary grabbing
her husband, and contributing with his own horror to doing so
building; and in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the
conviction, lost his senses too, and would have fallen on the steps,
but for Captain Benwick and Anne, who grabbed her and supported her between
them."Is there no one to help me?" were the first words that sprang from
Captain Wentworth, in a desperate tone, and as if with all his might
were gone."Go to him, go to him, cried Anne, for heaven's sake, go to him.I
can support her myself.Leave me and go to him.Rubbing his hands, rubbing
his temples; here are the salts; take them, take them."

Captain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same time, disengaging
himself from his wife, they were both with him; and Louisa was raised
and supported more firmly between them, and everything was done to
Anne had pushed, but in vain; while Captain Wentworth, staggering
against the wall for his support, exclaimed in the most bitter agony--

"Oh my God! His father and mother!"

"A surgeon!" said Anne.He caught the word; that seemed to wake him up immediately, and only saying:
"It's true, it's true, a surgeon this moment," rushed forward, when Anne
strongly suggested -

"Captain Benwick, wouldn't it be better for Captain Benwick?" He knows
where is a surgeon."

Anyone capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea, and in a
moment (everything was done in quick moments) Captain Benwick had resigned
the poor corpse-like figure entirely in the care of the brother, and was
on the way to the city with the greatest speed.As for the miserable part left behind, we can hardly say which
of the three, who were completely rational, suffered the most: the captain
Wentworth, Anne or Charles, who, really a very loving brother,
weighed on Louisa with sobs of pain, and could only look away from
a sister, to see the other in an insensitive state, or to testify
the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling her for help which he
couldn't give.Anne, assisting with all strength and zeal, and thought, who
instinct provided to Henrietta still tried, at intervals, to suggest
to comfort others, tried to calm Mary, to animate Charles, to
appease the feelings of captain Wentworth.The two seemed to be watching her
for directions.“Anne, Anne,” cried Charles, “what to do next?
for heaven's sake, must be done next? "

Captain Wentworth's eyes were on her too."Wasn't she better to take it to the inn?" Yes, I'm sure: wear it
gently at the hostel."

"Yes, yes, at the inn," repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively
collected and eager to do something."I will wear it myself.Musgrove, take care of others."

By this time, the report of the accident had spread among the workers
and the boatmen around the Cobb, and many were gathered near them, to be
useful if you want, in any case, to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady,
no, two dead girls, because it turned out twice as beautiful as the first
report.For some of the finest of these brave people, Henrietta was
recorded because, although partially resuscitated, she was completely helpless; and
in this way, Anne walking by his side, and Charles attending to his
wife, they stepped forward, stepping back with unspeakable feelings, the
soil, who so recently, so very recently, and so light-hearted, they
had spent.They weren't off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.Captain
Benwick had been seen flying near their house, with a face that
showed something was wrong; and they were gone immediately,
informed and directed in passing, to the spot.Shocked like
Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves that could be
instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife decided what was
be done.She must be taken home; all must go to their
to house; and wait for the surgeon to arrive there.They wouldn't listen
scruples: he is obeyed; they were all under his roof; and while
Louisa, under the direction of Mrs. Harville, was carried up the stairs, and
gave possession of his own bed, assistance, cordial, repairers
were provided by her husband to all who needed it.Louisa had opened her eyes once, but soon closed them again, without
apparent consciousness.It had been life proof, however, of
service to his sister; and Henrietta, although perfectly incapable of
being in the same room as Louisa, was held back, by the stirring of hope
and fear of a return of his own insensitivity.Marie was also
to calm down.The surgeon was with them almost before it seemed possible.They
were sick with horror, while he was examining; but he was not desperate.the
the head had suffered a severe bruise, but he had seen more serious injuries
recovered from: he was by no means desperate; he was talking cheerfully.That he didn't see it as a hopeless case, that he didn't say a
few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hopes of most; and
the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the joy, deep and silent, after a
some fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered,
To be conceived.The tone, the look, with which "Thank God!" was spoken by the captain
Wentworth, Anne was sure she could never be forgotten by her; nor the view
from him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it with folds
arms and face hidden, as if overwhelmed by the various feelings of
his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them.Louisa's limbs had escaped.There was only a head injury.It has now become necessary for the party to consider what was best to be
fact, as to their general situation.They could now talk to
each other and consult.That Louisa must stay where she was, however
painful for his friends to involve the Harvilles in such a
problem, admitted no doubt.Its withdrawal was impossible.the
Harvilles silenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all
Recognition.They had waited impatiently and arranged everything before the
others started to think.Captain Benwick must give up his room to
them, and get another bed somewhere else; and everything was settled.They
only feared that the house could no longer accommodate; and even
perhaps by "tidying the children away in the maid's room, or by swinging
a cot somewhere, "they could hardly bear to think of not finding a place
for two or three more, assuming they want to stay; But,
with regard to any presence on Miss Musgrove, it is not necessary that the
least concern to leave it entirely in the care of Mrs. Harville.Mrs
Harville was a very experienced nurse, and his nanny, who had
lived a long time with her, and went with her everywhere, was just such
another.Between these two, she could not wish for any possible presence by
day or night.And it was all said with truth and sincerity of
to feel irresistible.Charles, Henrietta and Captain Wentworth were the three
consultation, and for a while it was just an exchange of
perplexity and terror."Uppercross, the need for someone to go
at Uppercross; the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr.
and Mrs. Musgrove; late morning; an hour already passed
since they should have left; the impossibility of being in
tolerable weather."At first they weren't capable of anything more than
purpose that such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,
practicing, says--

"We must be decided, and without wasting another minute.All
the minute is precious.Someone must make up his mind to leave for Uppercross
at once.Musgrove, you or I have to go."

Charles agreed, but declared his resolution not to go away.He
would be as space-saving as possible for the captain and Mrs. Harville;
but as to leaving his sister in such a state, he must neither
would have.So far it has been decided; and Henrietta first declared the
even.She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently..the
usefulness of his stay! She who could not stay in
Louisa's room, or looking at her, without the suffering that made her
worse than helpless! She was forced to admit that she could do
not good, but still did not want to be absent, until, touched by the
thought of her father and mother, she gave it up; she agreed, she
couldn't wait to be home.The plan had come to this point, when Anne, quietly descending from
Louisa's bedroom, could only hear what followed, for the living room door
was open."So it is decided, Musgrove," cried Captain Wentworth, "that you
Stay, and let me take care of your sister at home.But for the rest, like
to others, if we stay to help Mrs. Harville, I think we must
only one.Mrs Charles Musgrove will of course wish to come back to
their children; but if Anne will remain, no one as decent, as capable as
Anne."

She paused for a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself like this
Talk about.The other two totally agreed with what he said, and she
appeared."You'll stay, I'm sure; you will stay and take care of her; he exclaimed,
turning to her and speaking to her with a gleam, and yet a sweetness, which
seemed almost to restore the past.She colored deeply, and he
regained his composure and walked away.She spoke the most
willing, ready, happy to stay."It was what she had thought
of, and wishing to be authorized to do.A bed on the floor at Louisa's
the place would be enough for him, if Mrs. Harville thought it."

One more thing, and it all seemed to be alright.Even if it was rather
desirable that Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove are previously alarmed by some
part of the delay; yet the time required by Uppercross horses to take
their return would be a terrible prolongation of suspense; and captain
Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed, that it would be a great deal
better for him to take a chair at the inn and leave Mr. Musgrove
the car and the horses must be sent home the next morning early, when it
would be the greatest benefit to send a review of Louisa's night.Captain Wentworth has now rushed to get everything ready for him,
and soon followed by the two ladies.When the plan was made
known to Mary, however, there was an end to all peace in her.She was
so miserable and so vehement, complained so much about the injustice of being
expected to leave in Anne's place; Anne, who was nothing to Louisa,
while she was his sister, and had the best right to stay with Henrietta
square! Why wouldn't she be as helpful as Anne? And to go home
without Charles too, without her husband! No it was too mean.And
in short, she said more than her husband could long endure, and like
none of the others could object when he gave in, there was no help for
he; Mary's change to Anne was inevitable.Anne had never submitted with more reluctance to the jealous and
the reckless pretensions of Mary; but it must be so, and they leave for the
town, Charles looking after his sister and Captain Benwick
to her.She gave a moment of remembrance, as they hurried, to
the small circumstances that the same places had witnessed earlier in
the morning.There she had listened to Henrietta's plans for Dr.
Shirley leaves Uppercross; farther on, she had first seen Mr. Elliot;
for a moment seemed all that could now be given to anyone but Louisa, or
those who were enveloped in his well-being.Captain Benwick was very attentive to him; and, united as
they all seemed through the distress of the day, she felt an increase
degree of benevolence towards him, and a pleasure even in thinking that
this may be an opportunity to continue their knowledge.Captain Wentworth watched for them, and a chair and four
waiting, parked for their convenience in the lowest part of the
street; but his obvious surprise and annoyance at the substitution of
a sister for the other, the change of her face, the
astonishment, the expressions begun and deleted, with which Charles
was listened to, but a mortifying welcome from Anne; or must to
convince her at least that she was valued only because she could be useful for
Louisa.She was striving to be composed and to be fair.Without imitating the
Emma's feelings towards her Henry, she would have attended
Louisa with a zeal over common respect claims, for him; and
she hoped it wouldn't be long enough unfair to assume she would shrink
unnecessarily from a friend's office.Meanwhile she was in the car.He had handed them both,
and stood between them; and in this way, under these
circumstances, full of astonishment and emotion for Anne, she left
Lyme.How would pass the long stage; how this should affect their
manners; what was their kind of sex, she couldn't
provide.It was quite natural, however.He was devoted to
Henriette; always turned towards her; and when he spoke, always
in order to support his hopes and cheer him up.In
general, his voice and manners were studiously calm.To spare Henriette
agitation seemed the guiding principle.Once only, when she had
grieved by the misjudged and unhappy last march to the Cobb,
bitterly deploring that no one ever thought of it, he burst,
so completely overcome--

"Don't talk about it, don't talk about it," he cried.."Oh my God! That I had
not yielded to her at the fatal moment! If I had done what I had to! But
so eager and so determined! Dear, sweet Louisa! "

Anne wondered if it had ever occurred to her now to question the
the correctness of one's own previous opinion as to universal bliss and
advantage of firmness of character; and if that couldn't hit him
that, like all other qualities of the mind, it must have its
proportions and limits.She thought it could hardly escape her
feel that a persuasive temperament can sometimes be so much in favor of
happiness as a very resolute character.They got along quickly.Anne was amazed to recognize the same hills and
the same objects so soon.Their real speed, increased by some fear
of the conclusion, revealed the road but half as long as the day
before.It was getting quite twilight, however, before they were in the
Uppercross district, and there had been total silence among
them for a while, Henrietta leaning back in the corner, with a shawl
on her face, giving her hope that she had fallen asleep crying;
when, as they were climbing their last hill, Anne found herself quite
when addressed by Captain Wentworth.In a low and cautious voice, he
mentionned:--

"I thought about what best we had to do.It should not appear at
first.She couldn't stand it.I thought about if you had
no better to stay in the car with her, while I come in and break her
to Mr and Mrs Musgrove.Do you think this is a good plan? "

She did it: he was satisfied and didn't say anything more.But the memory of
the call remained a pleasure to him, as proof of friendship, and of
deference to his judgment, great pleasure; and when it became a
kind of farewell proof, its value has not diminished.When the painful communication at Uppercross was over, and he had
saw the father and mother as calm as could be hoped for, and the
girl all the better to be with them, he announced his intention
to return in the same car to Lyme; and when the horses were
baited, he was gone.(End of volume one.)



Chapter 13


The rest of Anne's time at Uppercross, comprising only two
days, was spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the
satisfaction of knowing it extremely useful, both as
immediate companion, and as an assistant in all these arrangements for the
future, who, in the distress of Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove,
would have been difficulties.They had an early Lyme count the next morning.Louisa was a lot
the same.No symptoms worse than before had appeared.Charles came a
a few hours later, to bring a later and more specific account.He
was happy enough.We should not hope for a quick recovery, but
everything happened as well as the nature of the admitted case.In
speaking of the Harvilles, he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of
their kindness, especially Ms. Harville's efforts as a nurse."She really left nothing for Marie to do.He and Mary had been
persuaded to go to their hostel early last night.Mary had been
still hysterical this morning.When he left she was going
hanging out with Captain Benwick, which he hoped would do him good.He
almost regretted that she had been convinced to come home the day before;
but the truth was, Mrs. Harville didn't leave anything for anyone to do."

Charles was due to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father had to
first half of mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.The
would only multiply the troubles of others, and increase his
own distress; and a much better pattern followed and was implemented.A
chair was sent for from Crewkherne, and Charles brought a far
more useful person in the old nanny of the family, the one who
having raised all the children and seen the last, the
Persistent and long cherished Master Harry, sent to school after his
brothers, now lived in his deserted nursery to mend stockings and
dress all the wounds and bruises that she could approach her, and which,
therefore, was only too happy to be allowed to go and help the nurse
dear miss Louisa.Vague wishes to bring Sarah there, had occurred
forward to Mrs. Musgrove and Henrietta; but without Anne, it would hardly be
were resolved and found achievable so early.They were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for the whole minute
knowledge of Louisa, that it was so essential to obtain each
twenty-four hours.He made it his business to go to Lyme, and his
account was always encouraging.The meaning intervals and
we believed that the consciousness was stronger.Each report agreed in
Captain Wentworth's appearance corrected in Lyme.Anne had to leave them the next day, an event they all dreaded."What should they do without her? They were miserable comforters for
another."And so many things were said this way, that Anne thought she
could not do better than to communicate among them the general tendency to
that she was aware of, and persuaded them to go to Lyme at the same time.It
had little difficulty; it was soon decided that they would leave; go
tomorrow, to settle at the hostel, or to lodge, as it
adapted, and it stays until dear Louisa can be moved.They must be
take some trouble out of the good people she was with; they could
at least exempt Ms. Harville from custody of her own children; and in
In short, they were so happy with the decision, that Anne was delighted to
what she had done, and felt she couldn't make it through her last morning
to Uppercross better than helping their preparations and sending
remove them early, although she is left in solitary confinement
of the house was the consequence.She was the last, except for the little boys in the chalet, she was the last
very last, the only remaining of all that had filled and animated
the two houses, of everything that had given Uppercross its cheerful character.A few days had made a change indeed!

If Louisa recovered, everything would be fine again.More than old
happiness would be restored.There could be no doubt, in his opinion
there was none, of what would follow his recovery.In some months,
and the room now so deserted, occupied but by his silent and pensive self,
could be filled again with all that was happy and cheerful, all that was
beaming and shining in prosperous love, all that was most different from Anne
Elliot!

An hour of complete leisure for such reflections, on a dark
November day, a small heavy rain almost erasing the very few
objects to be seen through the windows, was enough to
the sound of Lady Russell's car is extremely welcome; and yet, yet
eager to leave, she couldn't leave the Mansion House, nor look like a
farewell to the Cottage, with its black veranda, dripping and without comfort,
or even notice through the misty glasses the last modest buildings of
the village, without a saddened heart.Scenes had passed at Uppercross
who made it precious.He held the record for many sensations of
pain, once severe, but now mellow; and some cases of slackening
feeling, a few breaths of friendship and reconciliation, which could
never to be wanted again, and who could never cease to be dear.It
left everything behind, everything except the memory that such things had
summer.Anne had never entered Kellynch since leaving Lady Russell's house
in September.It had not been necessary, and the rare occasions of his
being possible for her to go to the room she had managed to escape and
to escape from.His first return was to resume his place in modernity
and elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to delight the eyes of its
mistress.There was a certain anxiety mixed with Lady Russell's joy at meeting her.She knew who frequented Uppercross.But fortunately, either Anne
was improved in roundness and looks, or Lady Russell imagined it so;
and Anne, receiving her compliments on occasion, had the
the amusement of linking them to the silent admiration of his cousin,
and hope that she would be blessed with a second source of youth
and beauty.When they came to converse, she quickly felt
change.The subjects her heart had filled when she left
Kellynch, and that she had felt offended and obligated to
smothered among the Musgroves, had now become but of secondary interest.She had recently lost sight of even her father and sister and Bath.Their worries had sunk beneath those of Uppercross; and when Lady
Russell went back to their old hopes and fears and spoke to him
satisfaction in the Camden Place house, which had been taken, and
regret that Mrs. Clay was still with them, Anne would have
ashamed how much she still thought about Lyme
and Louisa Musgrove, and all her acquaintances there; how much more
Interesting was the home and friendship of the Harvilles and
Captain Benwick, as his own father's house in Camden Place, or his
his own sister's intimacy with Mrs. Clay.She was actually forced to exercise
herself to meet Lady Russell with something like the appearance of equality
solicitude, on matters which by nature had the first claim on it.There was a bit of awkwardness at the start in their talk about another
matter.They need to talk about the Lyme crash.Lady Russell had
not arrived five minutes the day before, when a full account of
the whole thing had shattered him; but we still have to talk about it, she must
inquire, she must regret the recklessness, deplore the result, and
Captain Wentworth's name must be mentioned by both.Anne was aware
not to do it as well as Lady Russell.She couldn't pronounce the name,
and look straight into Lady Russell's eyes, until she adopted
the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment
between him and Louisa.When that was said her name grieved her no
longer.Lady Russell had only to listen calmly and wish them a happy, but
inwardly his heart reveled in furious pleasure, in happy contempt,
that the man who at twenty-three seemed to understand a little
the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years later, be charmed
by Louisa Musgrove.The first three or four days passed most quietly, without any circumstances
to mark them except receiving a Lyme note or two, which
found their way to Anne, she didn't know how, and brought a
improvement of Louisa's account.At the end of this period, Lady Russell
politeness could no longer rest, and
the past became decidedly: “I have to call on Mrs. Croft; I really have
must call her soon.Anne, do you have the courage to come with me and pay
a visit to this house? It will be a test for both of us."

Anne did not retreat; on the contrary, she really felt like her
said, watching ...

“I think you are very likely to suffer more of the two; your
feelings are less reconciled with change than mine.By staying in
the neighborhood, I got used to it."

She could have said more on the subject; because she actually had such a high
opinion of the Crofts, and considered his father so lucky to
his tenants, felt that the parish was so sure of a good example, and the
poor of the best care and relief, who however sorry and ashamed
for the necessity of the abduction, she could not but in conscience feel
that they were gone who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall
had passed into better hands than its owners'.These convictions must
unquestionably have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they
ruled out the pain that Lady Russell would suffer upon entering the
home again, and returning through the well-known apartments.At such times, Anne did not have the power to say to herself: "These rooms
should only belong to us.Oh, how they fell in their destination! How? 'Or' What
outrageously busy! Such a distant old family!
Strangers filling their place! "No, except when she thought of her
mother, and remembered where she had been used to sit and chair, she
had no sigh of this description to push.Mrs. Croft always greeted him with a kindness that gave her the pleasure of
dreaming of being a favorite, and on the present occasion, receiving
her in this house there was special attention.The sad Lyme accident was soon the dominant subject, and on
comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared that each
lady dated her intelligence to the same time of yesteryear; this
Captain Wentworth was in Kellynch yesterday (the first time since
accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had not been
able to trace the exact steps of; had stayed a few hours and then
returned to Lyme, and with no current intention to leave
there is no more.He had inquired about her, she found, in particular; had
expressed her hope that Miss Elliot is not the worst for her
efforts, and had referred to these efforts as great.It was
beautiful, and gave him more pleasure than almost anything else could
have done.As for the sad catastrophe itself, it could only be approached in a
style by a couple of stable and sensible women, whose judgments should
work on the observed events; and it was perfectly decided that he had
was the consequence of much recklessness and recklessness; this
its effects were most alarming, and frightening to think, how
Miss Musgrove's recovery could still be in doubt, and just how responsible she is
would still remain to suffer the following concussion! the
The admiral ended him summarily, exclaiming:

"Yes, a very bad deal indeed.A new way, for a young person
boy making love, breaking his mistress's head, is not it,
Miss Elliot? It's breaking a head and giving a cast, really! "

Admiral Croft's manners weren't quite the tone to Lady
Russell, but they delighted Anne.His goodness of heart and his simplicity
of character were irresistible."Now that must be very bad for you," he said, suddenly waking up from a
little reverie, "to come and find us here.I did not have
I remembered it before, I declare it, but it must be very bad.But now do
do not stand on the ceremony.Get up and walk through all the rooms in the house
if you like it."

"Another time, sir, thank you, not now."

"Well, when it suits you.You can slip into the shrubs at
at any time; and there you will find that we keep our umbrellas hanging
this door.A good place isn't it? But, "(checking)," you
won't think this is a good place, because yours have always been kept in the
butler's room.Yes it still is, I believe.A man's ways can be
as good as any other, but we all like our best.And so you have to
judge for yourself if it is better for you
home or not."

Anne, finding out that she could refuse it, did so, very grateful."We made very few changes either," continued the admiral, after
think for a moment."Very little.We told you about the laundry room door at
Uppercross.It was a huge improvement.The wonder was,
how any family on earth could endure the inconvenience of their
opening as he did, too bad! You will tell Sir Walter what we have
done, and Mr. Shepherd thinks it's the biggest improvement in the house
never had.Indeed, I must do us justice to say that the few
the changes we have made have all been for the better.My
the woman should have the credit of them, however.I did very little
in addition to returning some of the large mirrors of my
dressing room, which was your father's.A very good man, and a lot
the gentleman I'm sure of it: but I should be thinking, Miss Elliot, "(looking
with serious thought), "I think he must be rather dressed
the man for his time of life.So many mirrors! Oh Lord!
there was no way to get away from you.So I asked Sophy to lend me one
main, and we soon changed their quarters; and now I'm quite comfortable, with
my little shaving glass in a corner, and another big thing that I
never come near."

Anne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed by an answer,
and the admiral, fearing that he had not been civilian enough, took
the subject again, to say ...

"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot, give
him my compliments and those of Mrs. Croft, and say that we are settled here
quite to our liking, and I have no problem finding with the place.The fireplace in the breakfast room smokes a little, I grant you that, but that's only
when the wind is due north and blows strong, which may not happen three times
once a winter.And take it altogether, now that we've stepped into
most of the houses here and can judge, there isn't one that we
like better than that.Please say so, with my compliments.He will be
happy to hear it."

Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very satisfied with each other: but
the knowledge that this visit began was destined not to go far to
gift; because when it was returned, the Croft's announced themselves to
leave for a few weeks, visit their connections in the north
county, and probably won't be home until Lady
Russell would move to Bath.Thus ended any danger for Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch
Hall, or to see him in the company of his friend.Everything was safe
enough, and she smiled at the many anxious feelings she had wasted
the object.Chapter 14


Although Charles and Mary stayed in Lyme much longer after Mr. and
Mrs. Musgrove goes what Anne thought they could have been at all
wanted, yet they were the first of the family to be home again; and
as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they proceeded to
the cottage.They had let Louisa start to sit down; but his head,
although clear, was extremely weak, and his nerves sensitive to
highest extreme of tenderness; and although it can be declared
very good overall, it was still impossible to tell when she
might be able to support the moving house; and his father and mother, who
must return in time to receive their youngest children for Christmas
vacation, barely had a hope of being allowed to take her with them.They had all been in lodgings together.Mrs. Musgrove had obtained Mrs.
Harville's children get away as far as she can, all supplies possible
Uppercross had been furnished, to alleviate the inconvenience of the
Harvilles, while the Harvilles wanted them to come to dinner
everyday; and in short, it seemed to have only been a struggle on every
side for which should be the most selfless and hospitable.Mary had had her ailments; but overall, as was evident by her
stay so long, she found more to appreciate than to suffer.Charles
Hayter had been to Lyme more often than he suited him; and when they had dinner
with the Harvilles there had only been one maid to wait, and
first, Ms. Harville had always given Ms. Musgrove priority; but then,
she had received such a nice apology from him when she discovered
whose daughter she was, and so much had happened every day,
there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles,
and she had taken books from the library, and changed them so often, that
the balance had certainly been very in favor of Lyme.She was
taken to Charmouth too, and bathed, and went to church,
and there were many more people watching in the church at
Lyme than at Uppercross; and all this, together with the feeling of being like this
very helpful, had really been a pleasant fortnight.Anne asked about Captain Benwick.Mary's face was directly darkened.Charles a ri."Oh! Captain Benwick is fine, I think, but he is very strange
a young man.I don't know what he would be in.We asked him to come
with us for a day or two: Charles undertook to give him some
filming, and he seemed rather elated, and, for my part, I thought so
was all settled; when here is! Tuesday night he made a very awkward
kind of excuse; `` he never shot '' and he had `` been quite misunderstood '',
and he had promised this and he had promised that, and the end
was, I found, that he didn't want to come.I guess he was afraid of
find it dull; but on my word I would have thought that we were animated
enough at the Cottage for a man as heartbroken as Captain Benwick."

Charles laughed again and said, "Now Mary, you know very well how
was really.It was up to you to play ”(turning to Anne.) "He imagined
that if he came with us, he should find you nearby: he believed
everyone to live at Uppercross; and when he found out that Lady
Russell lived three miles away, he missed his heart, and he did not have
courage to come.It's the fact, on my honor.Marie knows that it is."

But Marie did not give in very graciously, either no
considering that Captain Benwick had the right of birth and status to be in
love with an Elliot, or not wanting to believe Anne a greater
attraction to Uppercross than herself, must be left to guess.Anne's goodwill, however, was not to be undermined by what she heard..She recognized that she was boldly flattered and continued her inquiries..“Oh! He's talking about you,” cried Charles, “in those terms…” Mary
interrupted him."I declare, Charles, I've never heard of Anne
twice the whole time I was there.I declare, Anne, he never talks about you
at all."

“No,” Charles confessed, “I don't know if he ever does, in general.

extremely.His head is full of some books he reads on
your recommendation, and he wants to talk to you about it; he owns
discovered something or the like in one of them that he thinks, oh! I
I can't pretend to remember it, but it was something very good - I
heard him tell Henrietta everything; then 'Miss Elliot'
we talked about it in the highest terms! Now Mary, I declare that it was so, I
I heard it myself, and you were in the other room.'Elegance, softness,
beauty.' Oh! There was no end to Miss Elliot's charms."

"And I'm sure," cried Mary warmly, "it was a bit for him.
credit, if he did.Miss Harville did not die until last June.Such a heart is
very little value; is it not, Lady Russell? I'm sure you will
OK with me."

"I must see Captain Benwick before I make up my mind," said Lady Russell,
smiling."And which you will most likely be doing very soon, I can tell you, ma'am,"
said Charles."Although he didn't have the nerves to go back with us, and
then leaving to make an official visit here, he will
his way to Kellynch one day alone you can depend on it.I
told him the distance and the route, and I told him about the church
to be so well worth the detour; because as it tastes like this
things, I thought that would be a good excuse, and he listened with
all his understanding and his soul; and i'm sure in its way that you
will call him here soon.So I warn you, Lady Russell."

"Any knowledge of Anne will always be welcome to me", was Lady.
Russell's kind response.“Oh! As to being Anne's acquaintance,” said Mary, “I think he's rather
my knowledge, because I saw him every day this last
fifteen days."

"Well, as your common acquaintance, then, I will be very happy to see
Captain Benwick."

"You will not find anything very pleasant in him, I assure you, madam.He's one of the most boring young men who ever lived.He walked with
me, sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a
word.He's not a well-behaved young man at all.I'm sure you won't
Like him."

"There we differ, Mary," said Anne.."I think Lady Russell would like
him.I think she would be so happy with her mind, that she
would see no gaps in his way very soon."

"Me too, Anne", said Charles."I'm sure Lady Russell would like it.He's just the kind of Lady Russell.Give him a book, and he will read it all
all day."

“Yes, he will! »Exclaimed Marie in a mocking tone.."He will sit down thinking
on his book, and not knowing when a person is talking to him, or when
drop his scissors, or whatever happens.Do you think Lady
Russell would like that? "

Lady Russell couldn't help but laugh."On my word," she said, "I
I shouldn't have assumed that my opinion of anyone who might have admitted
such a difference in conjecture, stable and factual that I can
call me.I really have a curiosity to see the person who can give
opportunity to such directly opposing notions.I wish it could be induced
call here.And when he does, Mary, you can count on hearing my
notice; but i am determined not to judge it in advance."

"You won't like it, I'll answer for it."

Lady Russell started talking about something else.Marie spoke with
animation of their meeting with, or rather absent, Mr Elliot then
extraordinarily."He's a man," said Lady Russell, "whom I don't want to see..His
refusing to be on cordial terms with the head of his family, left
a very strong impression against me."

This decision ended Mary's eagerness and stopped her in the
in the middle of Elliot's face.As for Captain Wentworth, although Anne did not venture to inquire,
there was sufficient voluntary communication.His minds had been
has recovered a lot lately, as you would expect.As Louisa improved, he
had improved, and he was now quite a different creature than he
had been the first week.He hadn't seen Louisa; and was so extremely
fear of any harmful consequences for her of an interview, which he did
not at all insist on it; and, on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of
going for a week or ten days, until his head is stronger.He had
talked about going down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade
Captain Benwick to accompany him; but, as Charles maintained to the last,
Captain Benwick seemed much more willing to travel to Kellynch.There is no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally
Thinking of Captain Benwick, from that moment on.Lady Russell could not
hear the bell without feeling that it could be his herald; or
Could Anne come back from a walk of lonely indulgence in her
father's land, or any charity visit to the village, without
wondering if she could see or hear from him.Captain Benwick
did not come, however.He was either less willing than Charles had
imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him the indulgence of a week,
Lady Russell determined him unworthy of the interest he had
started to excite.The Musgroves have returned to receive their happy boys and girls from
school, taking Mrs. Harville's grandchildren with them, to improve
Uppercross noise, and decrease Lyme noise.Henrietta stayed
with Louisa; but all the rest of the family were in their habit again
quarters.Lady Russell and Anne addressed their compliments once, when Anne
couldn't help but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.Although neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter, nor the captain
Wentworth were there, the room was in as strong a contrast as possible
be wished in the last state she had seen in.Immediately surrounding Mrs. Musgrove were the Little Harvilles, who
she was seductively protecting herself from the tyranny of the two children of
the Cottage, come expressly to amuse them.On one side was a table
occupied by a few chatty girls, cutting silk and gold paper; and
on the other, trees and plateaus, bent under the weight of the muscles
and cold pies, where the rioting boys feasted; the totality
complemented by a roaring Christmas fire, which seemed determined to be
heard, despite all the noise of others.Charles and Marie too
came, of course, during their visit, and Mr. Musgrove insisted on
paying homage to Lady Russell, and sat beside her for ten
minutes, speaking in a very high voice, but with the clamor of
children on their knees, usually in vain.It was a beautiful family room.Anne, judging by her own temperament, would have judged such
domestic hurricane a bad nerve repairer, than Louisa
the disease must have shaken so much.But Mrs. Musgrove, who had Anne
near her on purpose to thank her very cordially, again and again, for
attention to them, concludes a brief recap of what
she had suffered herself as she watched, with a joyful gaze around the
room, that after all she had been through, nothing was more likely to do
its good as a quiet little mirth at home.Louisa was recovering quickly now.Her mother might even think of her
be able to join their party at home, in front of his siblings
went back to school.The Harvilles had promised to come with her and
stay at Uppercross, every time she came back.Captain Wentworth was gone,
for now, see his brother in Shropshire."I hope I will remember in the future," said Lady Russell, as soon as
they were reinstalled in the car, "so as not to call Uppercross in the
Christmas vacation."

Everyone has their taste for noises as well as for other subjects; and
the sounds are fairly harmless, or the most painful, by their kind rather
than their quantity.When Lady Russell, shortly after, was
enter Bath on a rainy afternoon and hike the long haul
streets from the old bridge to Camden Place, in the middle of
other cars, the heavy rumble of carts and carts, the howl of
newspapers, muffins and dairy products, and the incessant jingling of
pattens, she did not complain.No, these were noises that belonged
to winter pleasures; his spirits were raised under their influence; and
like Mrs. Musgrove, she felt, but did not say, that after being
long in the country, nothing could be more good for her than a little calm
gaiety.Anne did not share these feelings.She persisted in a very determined,
but a very silent loathing for Bath; caught the dark first sight
vast buildings, smoking in the rain, without any desire to see
better; felt that their progress in the streets was, however
unpleasant, but too quick; for who would be happy to see her when she
arrival? And looked back, with deep regret, at the stirrings of
Uppercross and the isolation of Kellynch.Elizabeth's last letter had communicated news from some
interest.Mr. Elliot was in Bath.He had called in Camden Place; had
called a second time, a third time; had been ostensibly attentive.Yes
Elizabeth and her father were not mistaken, had taken
much difficulty in seeking knowledge and proclaiming the value of
connection, for he had once been careful to show neglect.It was
very wonderful if it was true; and Lady Russell was in a very
pleasant curiosity and bewilderment about Mr. Elliot, already recanting
the feeling she had so recently expressed to Mary that he was "a man
that she didn't want to see."She had a great wish to see him.If he
really sought to reconcile as a devoted branch, it must be
forgiven for dismembering the father's tree.Anne was not so driven by the circumstances, but she
felt that she would rather see Mr. Elliot again rather than not, which was more
than she could tell for many other people in Bath.It was dropped off at Camden Place; and Lady Russell then went to see her
own accommodation, in Rivers Street.Chapter 15


Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place, a high
dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence; and at the same time he
and Elizabeth were installed there, to their great satisfaction.Anne entered with a heavy heart, expecting an imprisonment of
several months, and saying anxiously, "Oh!" when will I leave
still you? ”A certain unexpected cordiality, however, in the reception
she received, did him good.Her father and sister were happy to see
her, to show him the house and the furniture, and met her
with kindness.Let her make a fourth, when they sat down to dinner, it was
noticed as a benefit.Mrs. Clay was very pleasant and very smiling, but her courtesy and
smiles were more obvious.Anne had always felt that she
would claim what was suitable when he arrived, but the complacency of
the others were unexpected.They were obviously in a good mood,
and she would soon listen to the causes.They had no inclination to
listen to her.After giving some compliments to be deeply
regretted in their old neighborhood, which Anne could not pay, they
had only a few quick questions to do, before the conversation was
theirs.Uppercross aroused no interest, Kellynch very little: he
was all Bath.They were pleased to assure him that Bath more than answered
their expectations in all respects.Their home was undoubtedly the
the best in Camden Place; their salons had many decisive advantages
on all the others they had seen or heard, and the
the superiority was not less in the style of the arrangement, or in the taste
furniture.Their knowledge was highly sought after.Everyone wanted to visit them.They had withdrawn from many
presentations, and always had cards left by people
they didn't know anything about.Here are fun funds.Could Anne wonder if her father and
sister was happy? She may not be surprised, but she must sigh that her
the father should not feel any degradation in his change, should not see anything
regret the duties and dignity of the resident landowner, should
finding so much to be wasted in small towns; and she must
sigh, smile, and marvel too, as Elizabeth opened the
folding doors and walked gleefully from one living room to another
others, boasting of their space; to the possibility of this woman, who
had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding something to be proud of
between two walls, maybe thirty feet apart.But that wasn't all they had to make them happy.They had Mr.
Elliot too.Anne had a lot to hear from Mr. Elliot.He was not
only forgiven, they were delighted with him.He had been in Bath about
about two weeks; (he had passed through Bath in November, in his own way
London, when the intelligence of Sir Walter settled there had
of course reached it, although only twenty-four hours there, but
he had not been able to avail himself of it;) but he had now been a
two weeks in Bath, and his first objective on arriving had been to leave
his card to Camden Place, following it up with such diligent efforts
to meet, and when they met, by such an open mind,
such a willingness to apologize for the past, such a concern to be
received as a relationship again, that their old good understanding was
fully recovered.They had no fault to find in him.He had explained all the
appearance of negligence on his side.He was from
misunderstanding entirely.He never had the idea of ​​throwing himself
disabled; he had feared to be rejected, but he did not know why, and
delicacy had kept him silent.On the suspicion of having spoken
disrespectful or neglectful of family and family honors, he
was quite indignant.Him, who had never boasted of being an Elliot, and
whose feelings, as to connection, were only too strict to suit the
your non-feudal tone nowadays.He was astonished, indeed, but his
character and general conduct must refute it.He could refer sir
Walter to all who have known him; and certainly the pains he had taken
on this, the first opportunity for reconciliation, to be returned to the
foundation of a parent and presumptive heir, was solid proof of his
opinion on the subject.The circumstances of her marriage also turned out to admit a lot of
mitigation.It was an article he was not to enter into himself; But
a very close friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a very respectable
man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not a bad-looking man, Sir Walter
added), who lived in very good style in Marlborough Buildings, and
had, at his particular request, been admitted to their knowledge
through Mr. Elliot, had mentioned a thing or two relating to the
marriage, which made an important difference in the discrediting of it.Colonel Wallis had known Mr. Elliot for a long time, he also knew well
with his wife, had fully understood the whole story.She was
certainly not a family woman, but well educated, accomplished, rich,
and excessively in love with his friend.There had been the charm.she had looked for him.Without this attraction all his money wouldn't be
tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was assured of her
to have been a very beautiful woman.It was a lot to soften the
business.A very beautiful woman with a great fortune, in love with him!
Sir Walter seemed to admit it as a full apology; and although Elizabeth
could not see the circumstances in such a favorable light, she
allowed this to be a great mitigation.Mr Elliot had called several times, had dined with them once, obviously
delighted with the distinction of being asked, as they did not give any dinner
in general; delighted, in short, with every proof of cousin's opinion, and
put all their happiness into being in intimate relationships at Camden Place.Anne listened, but without fully understanding it.Allowances, large
it was necessary, she knew it, to take into account the ideas of those who spoke.She heard it all under embellishment.It all sounded extravagant or
irrationality in the course of reconciliation may have no
but in the language of the reporters.Yet, however, she had the
feeling that there was something more than immediately appeared, in
Mr. Elliot wishes, after an interval of so many years, to be well
received by them.In a worldview he had nothing to gain from being
in terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.In
in all probability he was already the richer of the two, and the Kellynch
succession would be as surely its beyond as the title.A sane man,
and he looked like a very sensitive man, why would that be an object
to him? She could only come up with one solution; maybe it was for
Elizabeth's sake.There may have been an addiction once,
although the convenience and the accident involved it in a different way; and now
that he could afford to please himself, he might want to pay his
address him.Elizabeth was certainly very beautiful, with
good manners, elegant, and her character might never have been
penetrated by Mr. Elliot, knowing her but in public, and very young
himself.How his temperament and understanding could support the investigation
of his present period of livelier life was another preoccupation and rather a
fearful.She very sincerely wished it wasn't too
kind, or too observant if Elizabeth was his object; and that Elizabeth
was willing to believe it, and that her friend Mrs.Clay was
encouraging the idea, which appeared by a glance or two between them,
while Mr. Elliot's frequent visits were mentioned.Anne mentioned the glimpses she had of him at Lyme, but without
be very taken care of."Oh! Yes, maybe it was Mr. Elliot.They weren't aware.Maybe it's him, maybe."They couldn't listen
to his description of him.They described it themselves; Mr.
Walter in particular.He did justice to his gentleman
his appearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his well-formed face, his
sensitive eye; but, at the same time, "must complain a lot about his being
under-hooked, a fault whose time seemed to have increased; he couldn't either
pretend to say that ten years hadn't changed almost every feature since
the worst.Mr. Elliot seemed to think he (Sir Walter) was
looking exactly like he did when they last broke up; "but Sir Walter
had "not been able to fully repay the compliment, which had
embarrassed him.He had no intention of complaining, however.Mr. Elliot was
better to watch than most men, and he had no objection to being seen
with him anywhere."

Mr. Elliot, and his friends at Marlborough Buildings, spoke about the
all evening."Colonel Wallis had been so anxious to be introduced
for them! and Mr. Elliot so anxious he should! And there was a Mrs.
Wallis, currently known to them only by description, for it was in
the daily expectation of childbirth; but Mr. Elliot referred to her as "a
the most charming woman, quite worthy of being known in Camden Place, "and
as soon as she recovered they had to get to know each other.Sir Walter
thought a lot of Mrs. Wallis; they said she was excessively pretty
beautiful woman."He wanted to see her.He hoped she could make it
redeems himself for the many very simple faces that he passed continuously in the
streets.The worst of Bath was the number of its simple wives.He did
does not mean that there were no pretty women, but the number of
plain was out of all proportion.He had frequently observed, as he
walked, that beautiful face would be followed by thirty, or
thirty-five fears; and once, while standing in a store on Bond
Rue, he had counted eighty-seven women who passed one after the other,
without there being a tolerable face among them.It had been freezing
morning, certainly, a sharp frost, which hardly a woman in a
a thousand could withstand the test of.But still, there was certainly a
frightful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for men! they or they
were infinitely worse.Scarecrows whose streets were full!
It was obvious that women were not used to seeing anything
tolerable, by the effect produced by a man of decent appearance.He
had never walked anywhere arm in arm with Colonel Wallis (who was a
beautiful military figure, although blonde) without observing that each
the woman's eye was on him; every woman's eye was sure to be on the colonel
Valais."Modest Sir Walter! He was not allowed to escape, however.His daughter and Mrs.Clay united to imply that Colonel Wallis
companion could have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis, and certainly
did not have blond hair."How is Mary?" said Sir Walter, in the height of his maid
humor."The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope
may not happen every day."

"Oh! No, it must have been quite accidental.In general, she was
in very good health and very good appearance from Saint-Michel."

"If I thought it wouldn't tempt her to go out into high winds, and grow up
rude, I would send him a new hat and fur coat."

Anne wondered if she should venture to suggest that a dress,
or a cap, would not be responsible for such abuse, when a blow to the
full hanging door.“A knock on the door! And so late! It was
ten o'clock.Could it be Mr. Elliot? They knew he had to dine in
Lansdown Crescent.It was possible that he would stop on the way back
to ask them how they did it.They couldn't think of anyone else.Mrs. Clay
I definitely thought it was Mr. Elliot's move."Mrs. Clay was right.With all
the state that a butler and foot boy could give, Mr. Elliot was introduced
in the room.It was the same, the same man, no difference except in dress.Anne stepped back a little, while the others received her compliments, and
his sister apologized for calling at such an unusual time, but "he
couldn't be so close without wanting to know that neither she nor she
friend had caught cold the day before, "& c.&vs; who was just like
politely done, and as politely taken as possible, but his part must
then follow.Sir Walter spoke of his youngest daughter; "Mr. Elliot
must give him permission to introduce it to his youngest daughter "(there was
no occasion to remember Mary); and Anne, smiling and blushing, very
appropriately showed Mr. Elliot the pretty features he did not have at all
means forgotten, and instantly seen, with amusement at his little departure
surprise that he had no idea who she was.He
looked completely amazed, but no more astonished than pleased; his
enlightened eyes! and with the most perfect eagerness, he welcomed the
relationship, alludes to the past and implored to be received as a
already know.He was as beautiful as he appeared
in Lyme his countenance improved as he spoke, and his manners were so
exactly what they should be, so polite, so easy, so particularly
pleasant, that she could compare them in excellence to one
the manners of the person.They weren't the same, but maybe they were
just as good.He sat down with them and improved their conversation a lot.There was no doubt he was a sane man.Ten minutes were
enough to certify that.His tone, his expressions, his choice of
subject, he knows where to stop; it was the whole operation of a
sane and insightful mind.As soon as he could he started talking to
she from Lyme, wanting to compare opinions on the place, but
especially wanting to talk about the circumstance of their arrival at
be invited to the same hostel at the same time; to give your own itinerary,
understand something to her and regret that he lost such
an opportunity to pay tribute to him.She gave him a short
story of his party and business in Lyme.His regret increased as he
listen.He had spent all his lonely evening in the bedroom
adjoining theirs; had heard voices, a mirth without ceasing; thought they
must be a most charming group of people, eager to be with them, but
certainly without the slightest suspicion of owning the shadow
a right to present oneself.If he'd only asked who the party was
have been! Musgrove's name would have told him enough."Well he
would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a
question in an inn, which he had adopted as a youngster, on
the principle of being very little distinguished to be curious."The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty," he said,
what it takes in manners to make it quite the thing, are more
absurd, I believe, than those of any other group of beings in the world.The folly of the means they often employ must be matched only by the
madness of what they have in mind."

But he should not address his thoughts to Anne alone: ​​he knew
he; it was soon broadcast again among the others, and it was only
intervals he could return to Lyme.Her investigations, however, produced at length an account of the scene which she
had been hired there, shortly after leaving the place.Having
alludes to "an accident", he must hear the whole thing.When he questioned,
Sir Walter and Elizabeth also began to wonder, but the difference in
the way they did it couldn't be insensitive.She could only compare
Mr. Elliot to Lady Russell, in a wish to truly understand what had
past, and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in
to witness it.He stayed with them for an hour.The elegant little clock on the fireplace
had hit "eleven with his silver sounds", and the keeper was
begins to be heard from a distance telling the same story, before Mr.
Elliot or one of them seemed to feel like he had been there for a long time.Anne could not have assumed that her first night at
Camden Place could have gone so well!



Chapter 16


There was a point that Anne, back in her family, would have
been more grateful to find that Mr. Elliot is in love
with Elizabeth, who was, her father is not in love with Mrs.
Clay; and she was very far from easy about it, when she had been at
at home for a few hours.Going downstairs for lunch the next morning, she
found that there had just been a decent pretext on the lady's side of
wanting to leave them.She could imagine that Mrs. Clay had said, that
"Now Miss Anne had come, she could not assume herself at all wanted;
for Elizabeth would reply in a kind of whisper: "It must not be
right, indeed.I assure you that I don't feel it.She is nothing to me
compared to you ; And she was full time to hear her father say,
"My dear madam, this must not be.You haven't seen anything yet
Bath.You are only there to be useful.You must not run away
from us now.You must stay to get to know Mrs. Wallis, the
beautiful Mrs. Wallis.To your good mind, I am well acquainted with the sight of
beauty is a real gratification."

He spoke and looked so seriously, that Anne was not surprised to
see Mrs. Clay take a look at Elizabeth and herself.Her
the face, perhaps, could express a certain vigilance; but praise
of the refined mind did not seem to excite a thought in his sister.the
Lady could only give in to such common pleas and promise to stay.During the same morning, Anne and her father risked being
alone together, he began to compliment her on her improved appearance; he
thought her "less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin, she
complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.Had she used
something in particular? "" No, nothing."" Just Gowland, "he supposed.."No nothing at all."" Ha! he was surprised at this; And added,
“You certainly can't do better than to continue as you are; you can not
to be better than good; or I should recommend Gowland, the constant use of
Gowland, in the spring.Mrs. Clay used it at my
recommendation, and you see what it did for her.You see how that
took away her freckles."

If Elizabeth could have but heard that! Such personal praise could
struck her, especially since it did not seem to Anne that the
freckles have been reduced.But everything must try its luck.The evil of a marriage would be greatly diminished, if Elizabeth were also
to marry.As for her, she could always order a house with Lady
Russell.Lady Russell's calm mind and polite manners were put to the test
on this point, in her sex at Camden Place.The sight of Mrs.
The clay in such favor, and of Anne so neglected, was a perpetual
provocation to her there; and annoyed her so much in her absence
person in Bath who drinks water, receives all new publications, and
has great knowledge, has time to be upset.As Mr. Elliot became known she became more charitable, or more
indifferent, towards others.His manners were immediate
recommendation; and conversing with him, she found the solid so fully
supporting the superficial, which she was at the beginning, as she told Anne,
almost ready to exclaim, "Can that be Mr. Elliot?" and could not
seriously represent a more agreeable or worthy man.Everything unites in him; good understanding, correct opinions,
knowledge of the world and a warm heart.He had strong feelings for
family attachment and family honor, without pride or weakness; il
lived with the liberality of a man of fortune, without display; il
judged for himself in all that is essential, without challenging the public
opinion at every point of the worldly decorum.He was regular, attentive,
moderate, candid; never run away by spirits or selfishness,
who believed himself to be a strong sentiment; and yet, with a sensitivity to
which was gracious and charming, and a kudos value from
domestic life, that the characters of imagined enthusiasm and violence
restlessness rarely really possesses.She was sure he hadn't been
happy in marriage.Colonel Wallis said it, and Lady Russell saw it;
but it hadn't been unhappy to sour her mind, nor (she started
soon suspect) to prevent him from thinking of a second choice.Her
Mr. Elliot's satisfaction outweighed the whole bane of Mrs. Clay.It was now a few years since Anne began to learn that she and she
a great friend might sometimes think differently; and he does not have
surprise her that Lady Russell sees nothing
suspect or inconsistent, nothing demands more reasons than
appeared, in the great desire for reconciliation of Mr. Elliot.As a Lady
Russell's point of view, it was perfectly natural that Mr. Elliot, at a middle age
moment of life, should feel it as a most desirable object, and what
very generally recommend it to all sane people, to be in good health
terms with the head of his family; the simplest process in the world
time on a naturally clear head, and only wandering at the peak of
youth.Anne, however, presumed to smile again, and finally to
mention "Elizabeth."Lady Russell listened, looked, and only did
this cautious answer: - Elisabeth! very good; time will explain to us."

It was a reference to the future, that Anne, after a little
observation, felt that she had to submit to.She couldn't determine anything
gift.In this house Elizabeth must be the first; and she was in the
the habit of an observance as general as "Miss Elliot", that all
the peculiarity of attention seemed almost impossible.Mr. Elliot too,
it must be remembered, had not been widowed for seven months.A little
the delay on his side could be very excusable.In fact, Anne could never
see the crepe around her hat, without fearing that she is there
inexcusable, by attributing to him such imaginations; for if
her marriage had not been very happy, yet there had been so many
years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery of
horrible impression of its dissolution.Whatever the ending, he was undoubtedly their nicest
acquaintance in Bath: she saw no one equal to him; and it was a big
the occasional indulgence of telling him about Lyme, which he seemed
have such a keen desire to see again and see more, as herself.They went through the details of their first meeting a lot
time.He made her understand that he had looked at her with some
serious.She knew it well; and she remembered another person
also look.They didn't always think the same way.Its value for rank and connection, it
perceived was larger than his.It wasn't just complacency, it was
must be a penchant for the cause, which brought him warmly into her
the solicitations of the father and the sister on a subject that she considered unworthy
to excite them.The Bath newspaper announced one morning the arrival of
the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple and her daughter, the Honorable
Miss Carteret; and all the comforts of No.-, Camden Place, was swept away
absent for several days; for the Dalrymples (according to Anne, most
unfortunately) were cousins ​​of the Elliots; and the agony was how
present yourself correctly.Anne had never seen her father and sister in contact with
nobility, and she must admit she was disappointed.she had hoped
best things of their lofty ideas of their own situation in life, and
was reduced to form a wish she had never foreseen; a wish that
they had more pride; for "our cousins ​​Lady Dalrymple and Miss
Carteret; »« Our cousins, the Dalrymples », echoed in his ears all day
long.Sir Walter had been in the company of the late Viscount before, but had
never seen the rest of the family; and the difficulties of
case arose out of the suspension of all sexual intercourse by
letters of ceremony, since the death of the said late viscount,
when, as a result of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter at the same time
time there had been an unlucky omission in Kellynch.No letter from
condolences have been sent to Ireland.The negligence had been visited on
the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself, no
letter of condolence was received at Kellynch and, therefore, there is
was too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered
relationship as closed.How to put this anxious business in place
rights, and to be admitted again as cousins, that was the question: and it was
a question which, more rationally, neither Lady Russell nor
Mr. Elliot thought unimportant."Family relationships have always been worth
preservation, good company is always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken
a house, for three months, in Laura Place, and would live in
style.She had been in Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had
heard of her as a lovely woman.It was very desirable that
the connection would have to be renewed, if that could be done, without any
compromise of convenience on the side of the Elliots."

Sir Walter, however, would choose his own, and ultimately wrote a
very nice letter of explanations, regrets and supplications to his
very honorable cousin.Neither Lady Russell nor Mr. Elliot could
admire the letter; but he did whatever it took, bringing three
dowager viscountess scribble lines."She was really
honored, and should be happy in their knowledge."The penalties of
the business was done, the candy started.They visited Laura Place,
they had the cards of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple and the Honorable
Miss Carteret, to organize where they could be most visible: and
"Our cousins ​​at Laura Place", - "Our cousin, Lady Dalrymple and Miss
Carteret, "we told everyone about it.Anne was ashamed.Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been very
nice, she would still have been ashamed of the fuss they
created, but they were nothing.There was no way superiority,
fulfillment or understanding.Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name
"a charming woman", because she had a smile and a civil response to
Everybody.Miss Carteret, with even less to say, was so simple and so
awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place but
for his birth.Lady Russell confessed that she had expected something better; but yet "that
was knowledge worth knowing; "and when Anne ventured to speak to him
notice of them to Mr. Elliot, he accepted that they were nothing in
themselves, but has always maintained that, as a family bond, as well
society, like those who would gather good company around them, they had
their value.Anne smiles and says:

"My idea of ​​good company, Mr. Elliot, is the company of the smart,
knowledgeable people, who have a lot of conversation; This is
what i call good company."

"You are wrong," he said softly, "this is not good company, it is
the best.Good company only requires birth, education and good manners,
and when it comes to education, it's not very nice.Birth and good manners
are essential; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing
in good company; on the contrary, it will be fine.my cousin Anne
shake your head.She is not satisfied.She is meticulous.Honey
cousin "(sitting next to her)," you have a better right to be
tedious than almost any other woman I know; but will he answer?
Will it make you happy? Wouldn't it be wiser to accept the company of
these good ladies of Laura Place, and enjoy all the benefits of the
connection as much as possible? You can depend on it, that they will
move into the first set in Bath this winter, and since rank is rank, your
being known to be related to them will be useful in fixing your
family (our family let me say) in this degree of consideration that we
must all wish."

"Yes," Anne sighed, "we will, indeed, be known to be related to them!"
then, remembering, and not wanting to be answered,
"I certainly think there has been too much trouble
make an acquaintance.I guess "(smiling)" I have more pride than
one of you ; but I admit that it annoys me, that we are like this
anxious to make the relationship recognized, which we can be very
it is a question of perfect indifference towards them."

"Forgive me, dear cousin, you are unfair in your own claims.In London,
maybe in your current calm lifestyle it could be as you say:
but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth
to know: always acceptable as knowledge."

“Well,” said Anne, “I am certainly proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome.
which depends so entirely on the place."

“I like your indignation,” he said; "it's very natural.But here you
are in Bath, and the object is to be established here with all
credit and dignity that should belong to Sir Walter Elliot.You
talk about being proud; They call me proud, I know it, and I won't wish
believe me otherwise; because our pride, if investigated, would have
the same object, I have no doubt, although the genre may seem a bit
different.On one point, I'm sure, my dear cousin, "(he continued,
speak lower, although there is no one else in the room) "in a
point I'm sure we must feel the same.We must feel that each addition
to your father's company, among his equals or superiors, can be useful
turning his thoughts away from those below him."

He looked, as he spoke, at the seat that Mrs. Clay had been on lately.
occupant: sufficient explanation of what he meant in particular; and
even though Anne couldn't believe they had the same kind of pride,
she was glad he didn't like Mrs. Clay; and his conscience
admitted he wanted to promote his father's success
knowledge was more than excusable in order to defeat it.Chapter 17


While Sir Walter and Elizabeth assiduously pushed their voucher
fortune at Laura Place, Anne revived a very
different description.She had called on her former housekeeper, and had heard about it
being a former schoolmate in Bath, who had both strong claims on
his attention to past kindness and present suffering.Miss Hamilton,
now Mrs. Smith, had shown her kindness in one of those periods of her
life when she was most precious.Anne had gone to school unhappy,
mourning the loss of a mother she had loved so much, feeling
her separation from home, and suffering as a fourteen year old girl, of
strong sensitivity and not in a good mood, must suffer at such a time;
and Miss Hamilton, three years older than her, but still
lack of close relationships and a stable home, remaining another year at
school, had been useful and good to him in a way that had considerably
eased his misery, and could never be recalled with indifference.Miss Hamilton had left school, got married soon after, was
said she married a man of fortune, and that's all Anne had
known to her, until now that the account of their governess brought her
situation in a more decided but very different form.She was a widow and poor.Her husband had been extravagant; and his
death, about two years before, had left its stuff terribly
involved.She had had difficulties of all kinds to deal with, and
in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe
acute rheumatoid arthritis, which, finally settling in her legs, had rendered her
the present a cripple.She had come to Bath because of it, and was
now in lodgings near hot baths, living in a very humble way, incapable
even to afford the comfort of a servant, and of course almost
excluded from society.Their mutual friend responded with satisfaction that a visit from
Miss Elliot would give Mrs. Smith, so Anne wasted no time
To go.She said nothing of what she had heard, nor of what she
intended at home.It wouldn't spark any interest.Only her
asked Lady Russell, who was deeply into her feelings, and
was very happy to transport her so close to Mrs. Smith's accommodation in
Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.The visit has been paid, their knowledge restored, their interest
one in the other more than revived.The first ten minutes had their
clumsiness and its emotion.Twelve years have passed since they had
parted ways, and each introduced a somewhat different person than the
others had imagined.Twelve years had changed Anne of flowering,
silent and shapeless girl of fifteen, to the elegant little woman of
seven and twenty, with all beauty except the flower, and with manners like
consciously righteous because they were invariably gentle; and twelve years old were
transformed the beautiful and well-developed Miss Hamilton, in all the glow
of health and confidence in superiority, in a poor, crippled, helpless
widow, receiving a visit from her former protege in favor; but all
who was uncomfortable in the meeting soon passed away, and left
only the interesting charm of remembering old partialities and
talk about the good old days.Anne found in Mrs. Smith the common sense and pleasant manners she
had almost dared to count on, and a disposition to converse and be
happy beyond his expectations.Neither the dissipations of the
past - and she had lived much in the world - nor the restrictions of
the present, neither sickness nor grief seemed to have closed her
heart or ruined his minds.During a second visit, she spoke with great openness, and
Anne's astonishment increased.She could hardly imagine more
joyless situation in itself as that of Mrs. Smith.she liked it a lot
of her husband: she had buried him.She had been used to wealth:
it was gone.She had no children to connect her with life and happiness
again, no connections to help sort out perplexed affairs,
no health to make everything else bearable.His accommodations were
limited to a noisy living room, and a dark bedroom behind, without
possibility of switching from one to the other without assistance, which
there was only one maid at home to pay, and she never
left the house but to be transported to the hot bath.Yet despite
of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had only had moments of
languor and depression, in hours of occupation and pleasure.How? 'Or' What
could it be? She watched, observed, reflected and finally determined
that it wasn't just courage or resignation.A
the spirit of submission could be patient, a solid understanding would provide
resolution, but here's something more; here is this elasticity of
mind, this readiness to be comforted, this power to turn easily
from bad to good, and finding a job that led her out
herself, who was of nature alone.It was the best gift of
Paradise; and Anne considered her friend to be one of those cases where,
by a merciful appointment, it seems destined to almost counterbalance
everyone else wants.There had been a time, Mrs. Smith told him, when her spirits had almost
lack.She couldn't call herself an invalid now, compared to her
state when arriving for the first time in Bath.Then she had, indeed, been a pitiful
object; because she had caught cold during the trip, and had hardly taken
possession of her home before being confined to her bed again and
suffer under intense and constant pain; and all this among strangers,
with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances to
this moment particularly unfit to face an extraordinary expense.It
had overcome it, however, and could truly tell that it had made him
good.It had increased her comfort by making her feel like she was
in good hands.She had seen too much of the world, to suddenly expect or
selfless attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved her
that his landlady had a character to preserve, and would not use it
sick; and she had been particularly lucky in her nanny, as a sister
of her landlady, a nurse by profession, and who has always had a home in
this house when he was unemployed, was lucky enough to be free just in time to
attend her."And she," said Mrs. Smith, "besides caring for me the most
admirably, really proved invaluable knowledge.As soon as I
could use my hands she taught me how to knit which was a great
fun; and she put me on the path to making these little ones
thread cases, pin cushions and card holders, that you always find me like this
busy, and which provide me with the means to do some good
to one or two very poor families in this neighborhood.She had a
great knowledge, of course professionally, among those who can
afford to buy, and she has my merchandise.She always takes
the right time to apply.Everybody's heart is open, you know, when
they have recently escaped severe pain or are recovering
blessing of health, and the rookie nurse knows full well when
speak.She is a clever, intelligent and sensitive woman.His is a line
to see human nature; and she has a lot of common sense and
observation, which, as a companion, make it infinitely superior to
thousands of those who received only `` the best education in the world
world, I don't know anything worth dealing with.Call it gossip, if you will,
but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour to spare, she is
sure to have something to tell that is entertaining and profitable:
something that makes its species better known.We like to hear
what is happening, to be aware of new ways of being
insignificant and silly.To me who live so alone, her conversation, I
assure you, is a treat."

Anne, far from wanting to quibble about the pleasure, replied: "I can easily
believe it.Women in this class have great opportunities, and if they
are smart may be worth listening to.Such varieties of
human nature as they used to testify! And it's not
simply in its follies, that they are well read; because they see it
occasionally in any circumstances which may be of the greatest interest or
affecting.What ardent instances must pass before them,
selfless attachment and self-denial, heroism, courage,
patience, resignation: from all conflicts and sacrifices
that ennobles us the most.A sick room can often provide the value of
volumes."

"Yes," said Mrs. Smith with more doubt, "sometimes, although I fear
his lessons are often not in the lofty style you describe.Here and
there human nature can be great in times of trial; but generally
in speaking, it is his weakness and not his strength that appears in a
sick room: it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity
and courage, which we hear about.There is so little true friendship
in the world! and unfortunately "(speaking low and trembling)" there is
there are so many who forget to think seriously until it is almost too late."

Anne saw the misery of such feelings.The husband had not been what he
should, and the woman had been led among that part of mankind that made
she thinks worse of the world than she hoped he deserved.It was only one
fleeting emotion, however, with Mrs. Smith; she rocked it, and soon
added in a different tone--

"I don't think the situation my friend Ms. Rooke is in right now,
will provide me with a lot either to interest me or to edify me.She is only breastfeeding
Ms. Wallis from Marlborough Buildings; a simple pretty, silly, dear,
a fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report
but lace and adornment.I want to make my profit from Mrs. Wallis,
However.She has a lot of money, and I intend for her to buy all the
expensive things that I have in hand now."

Anne had called on her friend several times, before the existence of
such a person was known in Camden Place.Finally, it became necessary
talk about her.Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs. Clay, made a
morning of Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple
for the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that
evening in Westgate buildings.She wasn't sorry for the excuse.They
they were only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple was kept at
at home with a bad cold, was happy to enjoy the relationship that had
been in such a hurry on it; and she refused on her own account with great
eagerness - "She was engaged to spend the evening with an old man
classmate."They weren't very interested in anything in relation to
Anne; but there were still enough questions asked, to do so
understood what this old classmate was; and Elizabeth was
disdainful, and severe Sir Walter.“Westgate Buildings! He said, "and who is Miss Anne Elliot?
to visit in the Westgate buildings? A Mrs. Smith.A widow Mrs. Smith; and
who was her husband? One of five thousand Mr. Smith whose names are at
to be met everywhere.And what is its attraction? How old she is
and sickly.My word, Miss Anne Elliot, you have the most
extraordinary taste! Everything that revolts others, low
company, miserable rooms, stale air, disgusting associations invite
yours.But surely you can postpone this old lady until tomorrow: she
is not that close to an end I presume, but that she can hope to see another
day.How old is he? Forty?"

“No, sir, she is not thirty years old; but I don't think I can put it back
my commitment, because it's the only evening for some time that goes
both suit me and me.She enters the hot tub tomorrow,
and for the rest of the week you know we're engaged."

"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?" request
Elisabeth."She sees nothing to blame in it," replied Anne; "on the contrary, she
approves it, and usually took me when I visited Mrs.
Black-smith."

"Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance
of a wagon set up by its sidewalk, "observed Sir Walter.."Sir
Henry Russell's widow, in fact, does not have the honor to distinguish his weapons,
but still a nice crew, and no doubt is well known for
pass on a Miss Elliot.A widow, Mrs. Smith, housed in the Westgate Buildings!
A poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty; a simple Mrs.
Smith, an everyday Mrs. Smith, of all the people and names in the
world, to be Miss Anne Elliot's chosen friend, and to be preferred
by her to her own family ties among the nobility of England and
Ireland! Mrs. Smith! Such a name! "

Mrs. Clay, who had been present while all this was going on, now thought he
advised to leave the room, and Anne could have said a lot, and did
long to say a little in defense of his friend is not very dissimilar
claims theirs, but his sense of personal respect for his father
prevented her.she did not answer.She let herself be
remember, that Mrs. Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty
and forty years old, with little to live on, and no last name of dignity.Anne held her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course her
heard the next morning that they had had a delicious evening.She had
was the only one of the ensemble absent, as Sir Walter and Elizabeth had
not only been quite in the service of his lordship themselves, but had
was in fact happy to be employed by her in collecting others, and had
bothered to invite both Lady Russell and Mr. Elliot; and M.
Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early, and Lady
Russell had arranged all of his evening engagements in order to wait
on her.Anne had the whole story of everything such a night could
lady russell supply.For her, her greatest interest must be, in
having talked a lot between his friend and Mr. Elliot; in
to have been wished for, regretted and at the same time honored for
stay away for such a cause.His kind and compassionate visits to this
old classmate, sick and reduced, seemed to have delighted Mr.
Elliot.He considered her to be a most extraordinary young woman; in her
temperament, manners, spirit, a model of feminine excellence.he could meet
even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits; and Anne couldn't be
given to understand so much by her friend, could not know she was
so highly rated by a sane man, without many of those pleasant
sensations her friend wanted to create.Lady Russell was now perfectly determined in her opinion of Mr. Elliot.She was as convinced of her intention to win Anne in time as of her
deserved it, and began to calculate the number of weeks that
would free him from all remaining constraints of widowhood, and
let him free to exercise his most open powers to please.She
would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she
subject, she would venture on little more than clues as to what might be
below, of a possible attachment on his part, of opportunity
of the alliance, to assume that this attachment is real and rendered.Anne heard it, and made no violent exclamations; she only smiled,
blushed and gently shook his head.“I'm not a match-maker, as you well know,” said Lady Russell, “being a lot
overly aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations.I only mean that if Mr. Elliot had to pay for his addresses in some time
to you, and if you are willing to accept it, I think there is
would be any possibility that you are happy together.One more
proper connection, everyone should consider it, but I think it could be
a very happy."

"Mr. Elliot is an extremely pleasant man, and in many ways I
think hard of him, said Anne, but we shouldn't agree."

Lady Russell let this pass and only said in reply: "I recognize that in
to be able to consider yourself as the future mistress of Kellynch, the future
Lady Elliot, to look forward to seeing you occupy your dear mother's house
place, succeeding all its rights, and all its popularity, as well as
to all its virtues, would be for me the greatest possible gratification.You are your mother's ego in face and disposition; and if I
could be allowed to imagine you as it was, in situation and name,
and at home, presiding and blessing in one place, and only greater than
it by being more valued! My very dear Anne, that would give me
more pleasure than often felt at the time of my life! "

Anne was obliged to turn away, to get up, to walk towards a distant table,
and, bent over there in a supposed job, try to control the feelings
this horny pic.For a few moments his imagination and his heart
were bewitched.The idea of ​​becoming what his mother had been; of
to have the precious name of "Lady Elliot" resurrected for the first time in herself; of
be restored to Kellynch, calling it again his home, his home for
ever, was a charm she couldn't resist immediately.Lady Russell
didn't say a word, ready to leave the matter to himself
surgery; and believing this, could Mr. Elliot at that time with
convenience spoke for itself! - she believed in short
did not believe.The same image of Mr. Elliot speaking for himself
brought Anne to her calm.The charm of Kellynch and "Lady
Elliot "everything passed out.She could never accept it.And it was not
only that his feelings were still unfavorable to all but one man; her
judgment, on a serious examination of the possibilities of such
the case was against Mr. Elliot.Although they had known each other for a month, she could not be satisfied
that she really knew her character.That he was a sane man, a
pleasant man, he spoke well, professed good opinions, seemed
judge correctly and as a man of principle, it was all quite clear.He sure knew what was right, and she couldn't fix on a single article either.
of manifestly transgressed moral duty; but yet she would have been
afraid to answer for his conduct.She was wary of the past, if not of the
gift.The names that sometimes escaped former associates, the
allusions to old practices and activities, suspicions suggested no
favorable of what he had been.She saw that there had been some harm
habits; that traveling on Sundays had been common; that there was
was a period of his life (and probably not a short one) when he had
been, at least, reckless in all serious matters; and, although he may
now think very differently, who could answer for the true feelings of
an intelligent and careful man, old enough to enjoy a fair
character? How could anyone ever make sure that his mind was really
cleaned up?

Mr. Elliot was rational, discreet, polite, but he was not open.The
There was never a surge of feeling, heat of indignation or joy,
to the harm or the good of others.This, for Anne, was a decision
imperfection.His first impressions were incurable.She enjoyed the
frank, open heart, greedy character above all others.Heat
and the enthusiasm still captivated her.She felt she could
depend much more on the sincerity of those who have sometimes watched or
said a careless or hasty thing, that of those whose presence of mind
never varied, whose tongue never slipped.Mr. Elliot was too generally pleasant.Various as were the temperaments in
their father's house, they all liked it.He endured too well, stood
too good with everyone.He had spoken to her with a certain
open-mindedness of Ms. Clay; had appeared completely to see what Mrs. Clay was
about, and to despise her; and yet Mrs. Clay found it as
pleasant like any body.Lady Russell has seen less or more than her young friend, for she has seen
nothing to arouse suspicion.She couldn't imagine a man more exactly
what he should be as Mr. Elliot; nor has she ever enjoyed a sweeter
feeling that the hope of seeing him receive the hand of his beloved
Anne at Kellynch Church, during the following fall.Chapter 18


It was the beginning of February; and Anne, having spent a month
Bath, was increasingly hungry for news of Uppercross and Lyme.It
wanted to hear a lot more than Mary had communicated.It was three
weeks since she hadn't heard anything.She only knew that Henrietta was at
home again; and that Louisa, although considered to be recovering quickly,
was still in Lyme; and she thought of them all very carefully one
evening, when a thicker than usual letter from Mary was delivered to
her; and, to accelerate the pleasure and the surprise, with the admiral and Mrs.
Compliments from Croft.The Crofts must be in Bath! A circumstance to interest him.They were
people to whom his heart turned very naturally."What is that?" cried Sir Walter."Have the Croftos arrived in Bath?"
The Crofts who praise Kellynch? What did they bring you? "

"A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir."

"Oh! These letters are convenient passports.They secure a
introduction.I should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any
rate.I know what is owed to my tenant."

Anne could no longer listen; she couldn't even have said how the poor
The admiral's complexion escaped; her letter absorbed her.He was
started several days ago." February 1st."My dear Anne, - I do not apologize for my silence, because I know how
little people think of letters in a place like Bath.You must be a
far too happy to take care of Uppercross, which as you well know
offers little to write.We had a very dull Christmas; m
and Mrs Musgrove did not have dinner during all the holidays.I do
don't think of the Hayters as just anybody else.The holidays, however, are over at
last: I believe that no child has ever had such long.i'm sure i had
do not.The house was cleaned yesterday, with the exception of the Little Harvilles;
but you will be surprised to learn that they never made it home.Mrs
Harville must be a strange mother to be separated from them for so long.I do not
understand it.They aren't nice kids at all, in my opinion; But
Mrs. Musgrove seems to like them as well, if not better, than she
small children.What a terrible time we had! It may not be felt
in Bath, with your pretty sidewalks; but in the country it is certain
result.I haven't had a creature call on me since the second
week of January, except Charles Hayter, who had called a lot
more often than welcome.Between us, I find it a shame
Henrietta did not stay in Lyme as long as Louisa; he would have kept
she a little out of her way.The car left today, to bring
Louisa and the Harvilles tomorrow.We are not asked to dine with
them, however, until the next day, Mrs. Musgrove is so afraid of her
be tired from the trip, which is unlikely considering
the care that will be taken of her; and it would be much more
convenient for me to have dinner there tomorrow.I'm glad you found Mr. Elliot
so nice, and I wish I could have known him too; But I
my usual luck: I'm always on the sidelines when something desirable is
In progress; always the last of my family to be noticed.What a huge
time Mrs. Clay stayed with Elizabeth! Does she ever intend to
go away? But maybe if she left the room vacant, we could
not to be invited.Tell me what you think of this.i don't expect
my children to ask, you know.I can leave them at the Big House
fine, for a month or six weeks.I heard this moment that the
Crofts go to Bath almost immediately; they think the admiral
gouty.Charles heard it quite by chance; they did not have the
the courtesy of giving me notice or offering to take anything.I do
don't think they improve at all as neighbors.We don't see it,
and this is really an example of gross inattention.Charles joins me
in love, and all is well.Affectionately yours,

"Mary M ---.“I'm sorry to say that I am very far from being well; and Jemima comes from
told me the butcher says there is a lot of sore throat
about.I dare say that I will catch it; and my sore throat, you know, is
always worse than anyone."


Thus ended the first part, which was then put into
envelope, containing almost as much more."I kept my letter open, so I can tell you how Louisa annoyed her
trip, and now I'm extremely happy I did, having a lot to add.First of all, yesterday I received a note from Mrs. Croft, offering to
transmit anything to you; a very kind note, friendly indeed, addressed to
me, as it should be; So I can write my letter like
as long as I love.The admiral does not seem very ill, and I sincerely
I hope Bath will do him all the good he wants.I will be really happy to
bring them back.Our neighborhood cannot do without such a pleasant
family.But now for Louisa.I have something to communicate that is going
don't be a little surprised.She and the Harvilles came very Tuesday
safely, and in the evening we went to ask her how she was, when we were
rather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the group, as he had
been invited along with the Harvilles; and what do you think was the
right? Neither more nor less than his love for Louisa, and
not to choose to venture to Uppercross until he has had a response from Mr.
Musgrove; because everything was settled between her and him before she came
away, and he had written to his father by Captain Harville.True, on
my honor ! Are you not amazed? I will at least be surprised if
you never got a clue because i never did.Ms. Musgrove protests
solemnly that she did not know anything about the matter.We are all fine
happy, however, because although it does not equal her marriage to the captain
Wentworth is infinitely better than Charles Hayter; and Mr. Musgrove
wrote his consent, and Captain Benwick is expected today.Mrs
Harville says her husband feels very much for his poor sister
Account; but, however, Louisa is a big favorite with the two.Indeed,
Mrs Harville and I totally agree that we like her better for having
looked after her.Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say; but if
you remember, I never thought it was attached to Louisa; I never could see
whatever.And this is the end, you see, of Captain Benwick's
be supposed to be one of your admirers.How Charles could have taken such
something in his head has always been incomprehensible to me.I hope he
will be nicer now.Definitely not a great game for Louisa
Musgrove, but a million times better than getting married among the Hayters."


Mary did not have to fear that her sister was somehow prepared for
the news.She had never been so amazed in her life.Captain
Benwick and Louisa Musgrove! It was almost too wonderful to believe,
and it was with the greatest effort that she could stay in the room,
maintain an air of calm, and answer common questions from
moment.Lucky for her, there weren't many.Sir Walter wanted
find out if the Croft's were traveling with four horses and if they
were likely to be located in such a part of Bath as might suit Miss
Elliot and himself to visit; but had little curiosity beyond."How is Marie?" said Elisabeth; and without waiting for a response, "And
pray, what brings the Croft's to Bath? "

"They come on the admiral's account.We think he is gouty."

“Tear and decay! said Sir Walter."Poor old man."

"Do they have any acquaintance here?" Elisabeth asked."I don't know; but I can hardly assume that in Admiral Croft's time
of life, and in his profession he should not have much knowledge in
a place like this."

"I suspect," said Sir Walter coldly, "that Admiral Croft will be the best
known in Bath as the tenant of Kellynch Hall.Elizabeth, can we
dare to introduce him and his wife to Laura Place? "

"Oh, no! I don't think so.Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins,
we must be very careful not to embarrass her with the knowledge that she
might not approve.If we weren't related, it wouldn't mean; But
as cousins ​​she would feel scrupulous about any proposal from us.We
better leave the Crofts to find their own level.There are many
weird men walking around here who I am told are sailors.the
Crofts will partner with them."

This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth's share of interest in the letter;
when Mrs. Clay had paid homage to him with more decent attention, in a
investigation after Mrs. Charles Musgrove, and her beautiful little boys, Anne was
freely.In her own room she tried to figure it out.Well Charles might be wondering
how Captain Wentworth would feel! Maybe he had left the field,
had abandoned Louisa, had stopped loving, found out he didn't love her.She couldn't stand the thought of betrayal or levity, or anything like that
misuse between him and his friend.She couldn't stand it
such a friendship that theirs should be broken unjustly.Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove! The fiery, joyful-talking
Louisa Musgrove, and the slaughtered, thinking, feeling, reading, Captain
Benwick, each seemed to have everything that wouldn't suit the other.Their most dissimilar minds! Where could the attraction have been?
The answer soon presented itself.He had been in a situation.They had
been thrown together for several weeks; they had lived in the same
little family celebration: since Henrietta left, they were to be
almost entirely dependent on each other, and Louisa, just recovering
of illness, had been in an interesting state, and Captain Benwick was
not inconsolable.It was a point that Anne hadn't been able to
avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as
Marie, according to the current course of events, they only served to confirm
the idea that he had felt a rise of tenderness towards herself.She didn't want, however, to take much more to satisfy her
vanity, that Mary could have allowed.She was convinced that everything
quite pleasant young woman who had listened and seemed to feel
he would have received the same compliment.He had an affectionate
heart.He must love someone.She saw no reason against their happiness.Louisa had a beautiful navy
fervor to begin with, and they would soon become more alike.he would have
become cheerful, and she would learn to be a Scottish enthusiast.
and Lord Byron; no, that has probably already been learned; of course they
had fallen in love with poetry.Louisa Musgrove's idea turned
in a person of literary taste, and sentimental reflection was
fun, but she had no doubts that it was.The day in Lyme, the
fall from the Cobb, could influence his health, nerves,
courage, his character until the end of his life, as deeply as he
seems to have influenced his fate.The conclusion of the whole was that if the woman who had been
sensitive to the merits of Captain Wentworth might be allowed to prefer
another man, there was nothing in the commitment to sustainably excite
wonder; and if Captain Wentworth hasn't lost a friend, certainly
nothing to regret.No, it wasn't regret that made Anne's heart
beat in spite of herself, and brought color to her cheeks when
she thought of captain Wentworth free and free.She had a few
feelings she was ashamed to investigate.They looked too
joy, senseless joy!

She wanted to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place it was
evident that no rumor of the news had reached them yet.The visit of
the ceremony has been paid for and returned; and Louisa Musgrove was mentioned, and
Captain Benwick too, without even a half smile.The Croft's had settled into Gay Street housing, perfectly
to Sir Walter's satisfaction.He was not at all ashamed of the
knowledge, and in fact thought and spoke much more about
admiral, that the admiral never thought or spoke of him.The Crofts knew as many people in Bath as they wanted, and
considered their relationship with the Elliots to be a simple matter of form,
and in no way likely to give them pleasure.They brought
with them, their country is used to being almost always together.It was
ordered to walk to avoid gout, and Mrs. Croft seemed to be going to share
with him in everything, and walk for his life to do him good.Anne
saw them everywhere she went.Lady Russell took her in her car
almost every morning, and she never failed to think about it, and never
not to see them.Knowing their feelings like her was the most
pretty picture of happiness for her.She always looked at them like
as long as she could, glad to believe she understood what they could be
talk, as they walked in happy independence, or just as
delighted to see the admiral's good handshake when he
met an old friend and observe their eagerness to talk
sometimes forming a small navy knot, Mrs. Croft
looks as smart and lively as any of the officers around her.Anne was too engaged with Lady Russell to walk often
himself; but it happened that one morning, about a week or ten days
after the Croft arrived, it was best for him to leave his friend, or
his friend's car, in the lower part of town, and back alone
in Camden Place, and going up Milsom Street, she got the right
chance to meet the admiral.He stood alone at a
print shop window, hands behind him, in full contemplation
of some imprint, and not only could she have passed him without having seen him, but she was
forced to touch him as well as speak to him before she could catch his
note.When he perceived and recognized her, however, it was done
with all his usual frankness and good humor."Ha! Is that you? Thank you
you, thank you.It treats me like a friend.Here i am you
see, look at a picture.I can never get by without
stop.But what is it here, as a boat! Check it out.Have you ever seen this stuff? What funny comrades your beautiful painters must
to be, to think that anyone would dare their life in such a shapeless place
old seashell like that? And yet here are two gentlemen stuck in it
mightily at their ease, and looking around them at the rocks and
mountains, as if they weren't to be turned upside down the next moment, that they
must definitely be.I wonder where this boat was built! "(Laughing
warmly); "I wouldn't venture out on a pond on horseback.Good,"
(turning away), "Now where are you going? Can I go somewhere for you,
or with you? Can I be of any use? "

"None, thank you, unless you make me happy with your
company the little way that our road passes together.I'm going home."

in the picture, as they started to move."Did you say you have something to tell me, sir?"

"Yes, I currently have.But here's a friend, Captain Brigden; I
will only say, "How are you?" as we pass, however.I won't stop.'How do you do?' Brigden watches anyone with me except my wife.She, poor soul, is tied by the leg.She has a light bulb on one of her
heels, as big as a three shillings coin.If you look through the
street you will see Admiral Brand come down and his brother.Shabby
guys, both of you! I'm glad they're not on this side of the road.Sophie can't stand them.They played a pitiful trick on me once: I ran away
with some of my best men.I'll tell you the whole story another
time.There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson.Look, he
sees us; he kisses your hand; he takes you for my wife.Ah! the
peace came too soon for this youngster.Poor old Mr. Archibald! How? 'Or' What
do you like Bath, Miss Elliot? It suits us very well.We are always

Morning; sure to have a lot of discussion; and then we move away from them
all, and we lock up in our lodgings, and shoot in our chairs, and
are as cozy as if we were in Kellynch, yes, or as we were even in
North Yarmouth and Deal.We don't like our lodgings here the worst I
can tell you, for reminding us of the ones we had first in North
Yarmouth.The wind blows through one of the closets in the same
path."

When they were a little further, Anne ventured to press again for
what he had to communicate.She hoped, once she got out of Milsom Street,
satisfy his curiosity; but she still had to wait, because
the admiral had decided not to start until he had obtained the
larger space and calm of Belmont; and since she was not really Mrs.
Croft, she must let him make his own way.As soon as they were enough
going up Belmont, he began ...

"Well now you're gonna hear something that will surprise you.But first
everything, you have to tell me the name of the lady I'm going to talk about
about.This young lady, you know we've all been so concerned
for.Miss Musgrove, to whom it all happened.Her
Christian name: I always forget his first name."

Anne had been ashamed to seem to understand as soon as she really had
did; but now she could safely suggest the name "Louisa"."

"Yes, yes, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that's the name.I wish young girls
didn't have so many beautiful Christian names.i should never go out
if they were all Sophys, or something like that.Well this miss
Louisa, we all thought, you know, marry Frederick.It was
courting her week after week.The only wonder was, what they could be
wait, until Lyme business arrives; so, indeed, it was clear
enough that they have to wait until his brain is tuned right.But even
then there was something strange about the way they were.Instead of
staying at Lyme, he left for Plymouth, then he went to see
Edward.When we got back from Minehead he had stayed at Edward's house,
and he's been there since.We haven't seen him since
November.Even Sophy couldn't understand it.But now the question has
took the strangest turn of all; for this young lady, the same miss
Musgrove, instead of marrying Frederick, must marry James
Benwick.You know James Benwick."

"A little.I know Captain Benwick a little bit."

"Well she has to marry him.No, they're probably already married,
cause i don't know what to expect."

“I thought Captain Benwick was a very nice young man,” said Anne, “and
I understand he has an excellent character."

"Oh! Yes, yes, there is not a word to say against James Benwick.He's just a commander, that's right, done last summer, and these are bad
times to continue, but it does not have another flaw that I know of.A
excellent and good fellow, I assure you; a very active, zealous
officer too, which is more than you think, maybe, for that
gentle manners don't do it justice."

“Indeed, you are wrong there, sir; I should never bode well for running out of
the spirit of Captain Benwick's manners.I thought them particularly
pleasant, and I will answer for it, they would generally like."

“Well, well, the ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather
too piano for me; and although this is very likely, it is all our bias,
Sophy and I can't help but think of Frederic's ways better than his.There is something more to our liking about Frederick."

Anne was caught.She had only wanted to oppose the all too common idea of
spirit and gentleness being incompatible, not at all
represent the manners of Captain Benwick as the best
perhaps; and, after a little hesitation, she began to say:
"I do not enter into any comparison of the two friends," but the
The admiral interrupted him with ...

"And the thing is certainly true.It's not just chatter.We
the credit of Frédéric himself.His sister had a letter from him
yesterday, in which he tells us about it, and he had just had it in a
letter from Harville, written on the spot, from Uppercross.I want to
they are all at Uppercross."

It was an opportunity that Anne could not resist; she said,
therefore, "I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of

worried.It seemed, last fall, that there was an attachment
between him and Louisa Musgrove; but i hope it can be understood
have worn on each side equally, and without violence.I hope his
the letter does not breathe the spirit of an abused man."

"Not at all, not at all; there is no oath or whisper of
from beginning to end."

Anne looked down to hide her smile."No, no; Frédéric is not a man to whine and to complain; he has too much
mind for that.If the girl likes another man better, he is very fit
she should have it."

"Certainly.But what I mean is I hope there is nothing in
Captain Wentworth's way of writing to make you suppose he thinks
himself misused by his friend, who might appear, you know, without
it is absolutely said.I should be so sorry that such
the friendship which has survived between him and Captain Benwick should be
destroyed, even injured, by a circumstance of this kind."

"Yes, yes, I understand you.But there is nothing at all
nature in the letter.He doesn't take it out on Benwick in the slightest;
is not content to say: "I am surprised, I have a reason of my own for
ask yourself that.'No, you wouldn't guess, from his way of writing,
that he had already thought of this Miss (what's her name?) for himself.He very generously hopes that they will be happy together; and here
nothing very ruthless about it, I think."

Anne did not receive the perfect conviction that the admiral wanted
forward, but it would have been pointless to investigate further.She therefore contented herself with banal words or
attention, and the admiral had everything in his own way.“Poor Frederic! he said finally."Now he has to start all over again
with someone else.I think we have to get him to Bath.Sophie must
write, and beg him to come to Bath.Here are enough pretty girls I am

don't you think, Miss Elliot, we better try to get him to Bath? "



Chapter 19


While Admiral Croft took this walk with Anne and expressed his
wish to bring Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth was
already on the way there.Before Mrs. Croft wrote it was
arrived, and the next time Anne came out she saw him.Mr. Elliot was dating his two cousins ​​and Mrs. Clay.They were in
Milsom Street.It started to rain, not much, but enough to provide shelter
desirable for women, and enough to make it very desirable for
Miss Elliot will have the advantage of being transported home to Lady
Dalrymple's car, which we could see waiting a short distance away; it,
Anne and Mrs. Clay thus became Molland's, while Mr. Elliot
approached Lady Dalrymple, asking for her help.He soon joins
them again, with success, of course; Lady Dalrymple would be very happy
to take them home and call them in a few minutes.His lady's carriage was a horse drawn carriage, and contained no more than four
with all comfort.Miss Carteret was with her mother; Consequently, he
was not reasonable to expect accommodation for the three Camdens
Place ladies.There could be no doubt about Miss Elliot.Anyone
suffered some inconvenience, she must not suffer any, but it occupied a little
time to settle the civility point between the other two.The rain
was a mere trifle, and Anne was very sincere in preferring a walk with
Mr. Elliot.But the rain was also a trifle for Mrs. Clay; she would do
barely let him fall off at all, and his boots were so thick! a lot
thicker than Miss Anne's; and, in short, her courtesy made her
just as impatient to reunite with Mr Elliot as Anne could be,
and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so
determined, that the others were obligated to settle it for them; To lack
Elliot claiming that Ms. Clay was already a little cold, and Mr.
Elliot deciding on appeal that his cousin Anne's boots were rather the
the thickest.It was decided accordingly, that Mrs. Clay should be of the party in the
carriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne, while she was sitting
near the window, very clearly and distinctly describes the captain
Wentworth walking down the street.Her start was noticeable only by herself; but she immediately felt that
she was the nastiest in the world, the most irresponsible and
absurd! For a few minutes, she saw nothing in front of her; that was all
confusion.She was lost, and when she scolded her senses, she
found the others waiting for the car, and Mr. Elliot (still
obliging) just left for Union Street on a commission from Mrs.
Clay's.She now had a great urge to go to the outer door; she wanted
see if it rained.Why would she suspect another motive?
Captain Wentworth must be out of sight.She left her seat, she would
go; one half of her shouldn't always be wiser than the other
half, or always suspecting the other to be worse than he was.It
I would see if it was raining.She was fired, however, in an instant by the
entry of Captain Wentworth himself, among a group of gentlemen and
ladies, obviously his acquaintance, and that he must have joined a
little below Milsom Street.He was more obviously struck and confused
by the sight of her that she had never observed before; he looked pretty
red.For the first time since their new acquaintance, she felt
that she betrayed the lesser sensitivity of the two.She had the
take advantage of him in the preparation of the last moments.All
overwhelming, blinding, disconcerting, first effects of strong surprise
were finished with it.Yet she had enough to feel! It was
restlessness, pain, pleasure, something between delight and misery.He spoke to her, then turned away.The character of his manners was
embarrassment.She couldn't have called it neither cold nor friendly,
or anything so certainly embarrassed.After a short interval, however, he approached her and spoke again..Mutual investigations on common subjects have resulted: neither one nor the other, probably,
much wiser for what they heard, and Anne continues
to be less comfortable than before.They had to be so
very together, were able to talk to a
portion of apparent indifference and calm; but he couldn't do it
now.Time had changed him, or Louisa had changed him.There was
consciousness of one kind or another.He looked very good, not like he
had suffered in health or in spirit, and he spoke of Uppercross,
of the Musgroves, no, even of Louisa, and even had a momentary gaze of
its own meaning of vault as he named it; but yet it was the captain
Wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to pretend he was.It didn't surprise, but it pained Anne to find that Elizabeth
wouldn't know him.She saw he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw
him, that there was complete internal recognition on each side; she was
convinced that he was ready to be recognized as an acquaintance,
expected, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with
unalterable coldness.Lady Dalrymple's car, for which Miss Elliot was increasingly becoming
impatient, now erect; the servant came to announce it.It was
it started raining again, and overall there was a delay, and a
bustle, and a conversation, which must make all the small crowd in the shop
understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey Miss Elliot.AT
last Miss Elliot and her friend, unsupervised but by the servant, (for
no cousins ​​returned), moved away; and Captain Wentworth,
looking at them, turned to Anne again, and by the way, rather than the words,
offered him his services."I am very much obliged to you," was his reply, "but I am not going with it.
them.The car could not accommodate so many.I walk: I prefer
market."

"But it's raining."

"Oh! Very little, nothing that I consider."

After a moment of pause he said: "Although I came only yesterday, I have
have already equipped myself properly for Bath, you see ”(pointing to a new
umbrella); "I wish you would make use of it, if you are determined to
market; although i think it would be safer to let me get you one
chair."

She was very much obliged to him, but declined everything by repeating to him
belief, that the rain would come nowhere, and adding,
"I'm only waiting for Mr. Elliot.He will be there in a moment, I am
Of course."

She had barely spoken the words when Mr. Elliot entered.Captain
Wentworth remembered him perfectly.There was no difference between
he and the man who had stood on the steps of Lyme, admiring Anne as
she passed, except in the air and the gaze and manner of the privileged
relationship and friend.He entered eagerly, appeared to see and
think only of herself, apologize for her stay, grieved for having kept
his waiting, and eager to move him away without further loss of time
and before the rain increases; And at another time they left
together, his arm under his, a soft and embarrassed look, and a
"Hello to you!" being all she had time for, by the way
a way.As soon as they were out of sight, Captain Wentworth's ladies
the party started talking about them."Mr. Elliot doesn't like his cousin, I think?

"Oh no, that's pretty clear.We can guess what's gonna happen there.He is always with them; half live with the family, I think.What
Very handsome man! "

"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at Wallises, said
he's the nicest man she's ever been in company with."

“She's pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when it comes to
look at her.It's not fashionable to say it, but I admit that I admire
she more than her sister."

"Oh me too."

"And me too.No comparison.But the men are all wild after Miss
Elliot.Anne is too delicate for them."

Anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he wanted
walked alongside him to Camden Place, without saying a
word.She had never found it so hard to listen to him, however
nothing could exceed his solicitude and care, and although his subjects
were mainly as they were always interesting: praise,
warm, fair and discriminating Lady Russell, and innuendo
very rational against Mrs. Clay.But now she could only think of
Captain Wentworth.She couldn't understand her current feelings,
whether he really suffered a lot of disappointment or not; and
until this point was settled she couldn't be quite herself.She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but unfortunately! Alas! she must
admit that she was not yet wise.Another very essential circumstance for her to know, was how long it
supposed to be in Bath; he hadn't mentioned it, or she couldn't
remember.He may be just passing through.But it was more
likely he should come stay.In this case, as responsible as
everyone had to meet everyone in Bath, Lady Russell
i'm likely to see it somewhere.Would she remember him? How would it be
all to be?

She had already been forced to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove
was to marry Captain Benwick.It had cost him something to meet
Lady Russell's surprise; and now if it was by chance
put in the company of Captain Wentworth, his imperfect knowledge of
the case could add another shade of prejudice against him.The next morning, Anne was with her friend, and for the first time
hour, in a sort of ceaseless and frightening vigil for him in vain; but at
finally, going down Pulteney Street, she distinguished him on the
right sidewalk at such a distance that he can see the
most of the street.There were a lot of other men around him, a lot
groups marching in the same way, but there was no doubt about it.It
instinctively looked at Lady Russell; but not from a crazy idea of ​​her
recognizing it as soon as she did it herself.No it shouldn't be
assumed Lady Russell would perceive it until they were almost
opposite.She looked at her, however, from time to time, with concern; and
at the approach of the moment which must signal it, without daring
to look again (for her own physiognomy which she knew unfit to be seen),
yet she was perfectly aware of Lady Russell's eyes turned
exactly in the direction for him - of his being, in short, carefully
observing it.She could perfectly understand the kind of fascination
he must possess on Lady Russell's mind the difficulty that he must be for
to remove her eyes, the astonishment she must feel
eight or nine years should have passed on him, and in foreign climates
and in active service too, without depriving him of a personal grace!

Finally, Lady Russell pulled her head back."Now how would she talk about
him?"

“You will wonder,” she said, “what has been staring in my eye for so long; But
I looked after window curtains, which Lady Alicia and Mrs
Frankland was telling me about last night.They described the
living room-window curtains of one of the houses on this side of the
path, and this part of the street, as being the most beautiful and the best hung
of everything in Bath, but I couldn't remember the exact number, and I
tried to find out what it could be; but I admit that I do not see
curtains here that meet their description."

Anne sighed and blushed and smiled, with pity and disdain, be it to her
friend or herself.The part that provoked her the most was that in all
this waste of foresight and prudence, she should have lost the right
moment to see if he saw them.A day or two passed without producing anything.The theater or the
the rooms, where he was most likely to be found, were not fashionable enough to
the Elliots, whose evening entertainment was uniquely in the elegant
stupidity of private parties, in which they became more and more
engaged; and Anne, tired of such a state of stagnation, sick of
knowing nothing, and believing himself stronger because his strength was
not tried, was quite anxious for the concert night.It was a
concert for the benefit of a person sponsored by Lady Dalrymple.Of
course they must attend.We really expected him to be good, and
Captain Wentworth was very fond of music.If she could only have a few
a few minutes of chatting with him again, she thought she should be
satisfied; and as for the power to address him, she felt everywhere
courage if the opportunity presents itself.Elizabeth had turned away from him,
Lady Russell surprised him; his nerves were strengthened by these
conditions; she felt she owed him attention.She had once partially promised Mrs. Smith that she would spend the evening with her;
but in a short hasty call, she apologized and pushed back, with
the more decided promise of a longer visit the next day.Mrs. Smith
gave a cheerful acquiescence.“By all means,” she said; "just tell me all about it when you come.Who's your party? "

Anne named them all.Mrs. Smith did not answer; but when she left
she said, and with a half-serious, half-bow expression: "Well, I
sincerely wish your concert can answer; and don't let go tomorrow if
you can come; Cause I'm starting to have a hunch that I might not have much
more visits from you."

Anne was surprised and confused; but after stopping for a moment
outstanding, was obligated, and not sorry to be obligated, to hurry.Chapter 20


Sir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs. Clay, were the first of all
their evening in the rooms at night; and as Lady Dalrymple must be
waited, they took their post near one of the fires of the Octagon
Bedroom.But they were hardly seated so well, when the door opened again, and
Captain Wentworth walked in alone.Anne was closest to him, and
making a little head start, she immediately spoke.he was preparing
only to bow and convey, but its sweet "How are you?" brought him
out of the straight line to stand near her and research
back, despite the formidable father and sister in the back
Earth.Their being in the background was a support for Anne; she knew
nothing about their appearance, and felt equal to everything she believed
right to be done.While they were talking, a whisper between her father and Elizabeth
grabbed his ear.She couldn't make out, but she had to guess the
matter; and on the distant reverence of Captain Wentworth, she
understood that his father had judged so well to give him that
simple recognition of knowledge, and it was just in time by a
side glance to see a slight curtsy from Elizabeth herself.This,
although late, and reluctant, and gracious, was even better than
nothing, and his morale improved.After speaking, however, of the weather, Bath and the concert,
their conversation began to falter, and so little was finally said that
she expected him to go every moment, but he didn't; he seemed in
in no hurry to leave her; and currently with a renewed spirit, with a little
smile, a little glow, he said -

"I've barely seen you since our day at Lyme.I'm afraid you have to
suffered from the shock, and in addition to its overwhelming step
you at the time."

She assured him that she did not have.“It was a terrible hour,” he said, “a terrible day! and he passed
his hand over his eyes, as if the memory was still too painful,
but after a while, half-smiling again, added: "The day has produced some
effects however; had consequences which must be considered as
the very opposite of the frightful.When you had the presence of mind to
suggest that Benwick would be the most suitable person to go for a surgeon,
you might get an idea of ​​what it is ultimately one of the most
concerned about his recovery."

"I certainly couldn't have any.But it seems - I should hope it would be
be a very happy match.There are good principles on both sides and
good temper."

“Yes,” he said, not looking exactly ahead; "but there, I think, ends
the resemblance.With all my soul I wish them happiness and joy
all the circumstances in his favor.They have no difficulty in
face home, no opposition, no whim, no delay.the
The Musgroves behave like them, very honorably and well
only caring with true parental hearts to promote their daughter's life
comfort.All of this is much, much in favor of their happiness;
more than maybe ... "

He stopped.A sudden memory seemed to occur and give him
a taste for that emotion that made Anne's cheeks blush and stare
his eyes on the ground.After clearing his throat, he
proceeded thus -

"I admit that I think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,
and in a point no less essential than the mind.I watch Louisa Musgrove
like a very kind, gentle and not deficient girl
understanding, but Benwick is something more.He's a smart man, a
reading man; and I admit that I consider that he is attached to
her with some surprise.If it had been the effect of gratitude, had he
learned to love him, because he believed that she preferred him, he
would have been something else.But I have no reason to assume it so.On the contrary, it seems to have been perfectly spontaneous,
feeling not learned from his side, and it surprises me.A man like him,
in his situation! with a pierced, hurt, almost broken heart! Cat
Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her was
indeed the attachment.A man does not recover from such devotion to
heart to such a woman.He should not ; he does not do."

Either of the awareness, however, that his friend had recovered,
or of another conscience, he went no further; and Anne who, despite
of the restless voice in which the last part had been spoken, and in
despite all the various noises in the room, the almost incessant banging
door, and the incessant buzz of people passing through, had
distinguished every word, was struck, satisfied, confused and
start to breathe very quickly and feel a hundred things in one
moment.It was impossible for him to enter into such a subject; and even,
after a break, feeling the need to speak, and not having the
smallest wish for total change, she only stepped aside to say:

"Did you have a good time at Lyme, I think?"

"About a fortnight.I couldn't leave it until Louisa was doing well
quite established.I had been too deeply concerned with the mischief to
soon be at peace.It was my doing, only mine.she wouldn't be
to have been stubborn if I hadn't been weak.The country around Lyme is
very good.I have walked and climbed a lot; and the more I saw, the
the more I found to admire."

"I would love to see Lyme again," said Anne."Indeed! I shouldn't have assumed that you could have found something
to Lyme to inspire such a feeling.The horror and the distress that you were
involved in, stretching the mind, wearing out the spirits! I should have
I thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been a strong loathing."

"The last few hours have certainly been very painful," replied Anne; "but when
the pain is over, the memory often becomes a pleasure.We do
love a place no less for having suffered there, unless it has been
all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was by no means the case at
Lyme.We have only been in anxiety and distress for the last two hours,
and before there had been a lot of fun.So many
novelty and beauty! I have traveled so little that every cool place
would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty in Lyme; and in
short "(with a slight blush at certain memories)," quite my
impressions of the place are very pleasant."

As she ceased, the front door opened again, and the party itself
appeared for whom they waited."Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple",
was the cheering sound; and with all the eagerness compatible with
anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet
her.Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr. Elliot and
Colonel Wallis, who arrived at about the same time,
walked into the room.The others joined them, and it was a group of
that Anne was also necessarily included.she was divided
of Captain Wentworth.Their interesting, almost too interesting
the conversation must be interrupted for a while, but the penance was light
compared to the happiness that brought him! She had learned, by
the last ten minutes, no more feelings for Louisa, no more
her feelings that she dared not think about; and she indulged in the
party requests, with the necessary civilities of the moment, with
exquisite but restless sensations.She was in a good mood with
all.She had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and
kind to everyone, and to pity everyone, as being less happy than herself.The delicious emotions were a bit subdued, when stepping back
of the group, to be joined by Captain Wentworth, she saw that
he was gone.She was just in time to see it turn into a gig
Bedroom.He was gone; he was gone, she felt a moment of regret.But "they should meet again.He would look for her, he would find her
before the night was over, and now, maybe, it was like
separate well.She needed a little interval to
memory."

When Lady Russell appeared soon after, the whole party was
gathered, and all that was left was to come together, and proceed
in the concert hall; and be of all consequence in their power,
attract so many eyes, excite as many whispers and disturb as many people
as they could.Elizabeth and Anne Elliot were very, very happy when they walked in.Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking over the broad back
of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish for
for who did not seem within reach; and Anne - but that would be a
insult to the nature of Anne's bliss, to make a comparison between
her and her sister's; the origin of the one all selfish vanity, of the other
any generous attachment.Anne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brightness of the room.Her
happiness came from within.Her eyes were bright and her cheeks were shining;
but she didn't know.She only thought about the last half
hour, and as they passed their seats, his mind took a hasty range
Above.His choice of subjects, his expressions and even more his
the manner and appearance, had been such that she could see in one light.His
opinion of Louisa Musgrove's inferiority, opinion he had
seemed anxious to give, his wonder to Captain Benwick, his feelings
as to a first strong attachment; sentences started that he could not
finish, his eyes half-turned away and more than an expressive half-look,
all, all declared that he had a heart which at least returned to him; this
the anger, resentment, avoidance were gone; and that they were
successful, not only by friendship and respect, but by tenderness
the past.Yes, part of the tenderness of the past.She could
do not view change as involving less.He must love her.They were thoughts, with their corresponding visions, which
agitated him too much not to leave him any power of observation; and she
crossed the room without noticing it, without even
try to discern it.When their places have been determined, and they
were all well arranged, she looked around to see if it should happen
be in the same part of the room, but it was not; his eye could not
reach it; and the concert being only at the opening, she must consent to a
it's time to be happy in a more humble way.The party was divided and arranged on two contiguous benches: Anne
was among the first, and Mr. Elliot had maneuvered so well,
with the help of his friend Colonel Wallis, to have a seat
her.Miss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the main object
of the gallantry of Colonel Wallis, was quite satisfied.Anne's mind was in a most favorable condition for the entertainment of the
evening; it was just enough occupation: she had feelings for the
tender, spirits for gays, attention for scientists and patience
for the tired; and never liked a concert better, at least
during the first act.Towards the end, in the meantime
succeeding an Italian song, she explained the lyrics of the song to Mr.
Elliot.They had a concert bill between them."This," she said, "is almost the meaning, or rather the meaning of
words, because certainly the meaning of an Italian love song should not be
spoken, but that's also close to the meaning I can give; because I don't
pretend to understand the language.I am a very bad Italian scholar."

"Yes, yes I see you are.I see you don't know anything.You
only have sufficient knowledge of the language to visually translate these
Italian lines inverted, transposed, shortened, in clear,
understandable and elegant English.You don't need to say more
your ignorance.Here is the full proof."

"I will not object to such politeness, but I would be sorry to be
examined by a real competent."

"I haven't had the pleasure of visiting Camden Place for so long,"
he replied, knowing nothing of Miss Anne Elliot; and i do
considers her too modest a person for the world in general to be
aware of half of her accomplishments and too accomplished to
modesty to be natural in any other woman."

"For shame! For shame! It's too much flattery.I forget what we are
have the next one, "turning to the bill.“Maybe,” Mr. Elliot said, speaking low, “I had a longer
knowledge of your character that you do not know."

"Indeed! What do you mean? You can only know about it since I
came to Bath, except for what you might previously hear about me in my
own family."

"I knew you by comparison long before you came to Bath.I heard you
described by those who knew you intimately.I knew
with you by character for many years.Your person, your disposition,
achievements, manner; they were all there for me."

Mr Elliot was not disappointed with the interest he hoped to generate.No
we can bear the charm of such a mystery.having been described
long ago to recent acquaintance, by anonymous people, is irresistible;
and Anne was all curiosity.She wondered and questioned him eagerly;
but in vain.He was delighted to be asked, but he didn't want to say."No, no, at one time or another, maybe, but not now.He wouldn't mention
names now; but such, he could assure it, had been the fact.He had
many years ago received a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had
inspired him with the highest idea of ​​his merit, and excited the
the warmest curiosity to know her."

Anne couldn't think of anyone so likely to have spoken with partiality about
many years ago under the name of Mr. Wentworth of Monkford, Captain Wentworth's
brother.He may have been with Mr. Elliot, but she did not have
courage to ask the question.“The name of Anne Elliot,” he says, “has long sounded interesting
tome.He has had a charm on my fancy for a long time; and if I
I dared, I would blow my wishes that the name never changes."

Such were, she believed, his words; but hardly had she received their
sound, that his attention was drawn to other sounds immediately behind
her, which made everything else insignificant.His father and his lady
Dalrymple was talking."A handsome man," said Sir Walter, "a very handsome man."

“A very handsome young man indeed! said Lady Dalrymple."More air than
we often see in Bath.Irish, I dare say."

"No, I just know his name.Knowledge that inclines.Wentworth; Captain
Navy Wentworth.Her sister married my tenant in Somersetshire,
the Croft, which praises Kellynch."

Before Sir Walter reached this point, Anne's eyes had caught the
good leadership, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among a
group of men at a short distance.As her eyes rested on him, her
seemed to have withdrawn from her.He had this appearance.It seemed that
if it had been a moment too late; and as long as she dared to observe,
he no longer looked: but the performance began again, and she
was forced to seem to turn her attention back to the orchestra and watch
straightforward.When she could give another look he had walked away.He could not
to have approached her if he wanted to; she was so surrounded and locked up:
but she would have preferred to attract his attention.Mr Elliot's speech also shocked her.She didn't have any more
want to talk to him.She wished him not so close to her.The first act was over.Now she hoped for a beneficial change; and,
after a period of silence within the party, some of them
decide to go in search of tea.Anne was one of the few not
choose to move.She remained in her place, as did Lady Russell; But
she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr. Elliot; and she didn't mean,
whatever she may feel about Lady Russell,
conversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave him the opportunity.She was convinced by Lady Russell's face that she had seen him.He didn't come though.Anne sometimes thought she could discern him from a
distance, but he never came.The anxious interval has dissipated
unproductive.The others came back, the room filled up again, benches
were picked up and taken back, and another hour of fun or
penance was to be accomplished, another hour of music was to please or
openings, because the real or affected taste for it prevailed.For Anne, it
mainly carried the prospect of an hour of unrest.She couldn't give up
this room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth again, without
the exchange of a friendly look.Reconstituting there were now many changes, the result of
what was favorable to him.Colonel Wallis refused to sit down
again, and Mr. Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a
a way of not being refused, of sitting down between them; and by another
moves, and a little intrigue on her part, Anne was able to place
herself much closer to the end of the bench than she had been before, much
more within reach of a passerby.She couldn't do it without
comparing herself to Mlle Larolles, the inimitable Mlle Larolles; But
she did it anyway, and not with a much happier effect; although by what
seemed prosperity in the form of an early abdication in his next
neighbors, she found herself at the end of the bench before the
concert closed.Such was his situation, with vacant space at hand, when the captain
Wentworth was in sight again.She saw him not far away.He saw her
too much; yet he looked serious, and seemed unresolved, and only by very slow
the diplomas finally approached enough to speak to him.She felt that
something must be the problem.The change was unmistakable.the
difference between his current tune and what he had been in the Octagon
The room was incredibly awesome.Why was that? She thought of her father, of
Lady Russell.Would there have been nasty looks? He started
speaking gravely about the gig, more like Captain Wentworth from
Uppercross; confessed disappointed, had expected to sing; and in
In short, we must admit that we should not regret when it was over.Anne
responded, and spoke so well in performance defense, and yet in
take into account his feelings so pleasantly, that his face
improved, and he responded again with almost a smile.They talked for a
a few more minutes; improvement has taken place; he even looked towards the
bench, as if he saw in it a place well worth the trouble of occupying; when to that
moment when a touch on her shoulder forced Anne to turn.It came
by Mr. Elliot.He asked her for forgiveness, but you must address herself to her, to
explain italian again.Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a
general idea of ​​what was going to be sung.Anne couldn't refuse; But
never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering mind.A few minutes, though as little as possible, were inevitably consumed; and
when her own mistress again, when she can turn around and look like she did
before, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth, in a
another kind of hasty farewell.“He must wish her good night; it was
To go; he should get home as fast as he could."

"Isn't this song worth staying?" said Anne, suddenly struck by a
idea that made her even more eager to encourage."No!" he impressively replied, "there is nothing I stay for;"
and he left directly.Jealousy of Mr. Elliot! It was the only intelligible motive.Captain
Wentworth jealous of his affection! Could she have believed it for a week
since; three hours ago! For a while the gratification was exquisite.But unfortunately! there were very different thoughts to be successful.How was it
jealousy to appease? How could the truth reach him? How, in all
the particular disadvantages of their respective situations, would it be
ever learn from her true feelings? It was misery to think of Mr.
Elliot's attentions.Their evil was incalculable.Chapter 21


Anne remembered with pleasure the next morning her promise to go to
Mrs. Smith, that is, she should hire him from her home when
Mr. Elliot would be most likely to call; because to avoid Mr. Elliot was
almost a first object.She felt a lot of kindness towards him.Despite the
mischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and respect, perhaps
compassion.She couldn't help but think about the extraordinary a lot
circumstances of their knowledge, of the right
seemed to interest him, by everything in situation, by his own
feelings, by his precocious prepossession.It was quite very
extraordinary; flattering but painful.There was a lot to regret.How? 'Or' What
she might have thought if it hadn't been for Captain Wentworth in the affair,
not worth questioning; for there was a Captain Wentworth; and be the
conclusion of the present good or bad suspense, his affection would be
his forever.Their union, she believed, could no longer divide her
of other men, that their final separation.Prettier reveries of highly worked love and eternal constancy, could
never crossed the streets of Bath, which Anne wore
with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings.It was almost enough
spread the purification and fragrance throughout.She was sure of a pleasant welcome; and her friend looked like this
morning particularly obliged to come, hardly seemed to have
was waiting for her, even if it was a date.An account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne
memories of the concert were happy enough to liven it up
features and make her happy to talk about it.All she could say
she said very willingly, but everything was small for the one who had been
there, and unsatisfactory for an investigator such as Mrs. Smith, who had
already heard, by the shortcut of a laundress and a waiter,
rather more of the general success and the products of the evening than Anne
could relate, and who has now unsuccessfully asked several details of the
business.Everyone of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was fine
know by name to mrs smith."The little Durands were there, I concluded," she said, "with their
Mouths open to catch the music, like lead-free sparrows ready to be
fed.They never miss a concert."

"Yes, I haven't seen them myself, but I heard Mr. Elliot say they were in
bedroom."

“The Ibbotsons, were they there? And the two new beauties, with the
great Irish officer, of which one speaks for one of them."

"I do not know.I don't think they were."

"Old Lady Mary Maclean? I don't need to ask her after her.She never fails, I
know; and you must have seen her.She must have been in yours
circle; because while you were going with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of
grandeur, around the orchestra, of course."

"No, that was what I was dreading.It would have been very unpleasant to me
in all respects.But luckily Lady Dalrymple still chooses to be
further; and we were extremely well placed, that is to say, to hear;
I must not say to see, because it seems to me to have seen very little."

"Oh! You saw enough for your own amusement.I can understand.The
is a kind of domestic pleasure to experience even in a crowd, and this
you had.You were a big party in you, and you didn't want anything
beyond."

"But I should have looked more around me," said Anne, conscious while
she said that indeed we had not failed to watch, that
the object alone had been deficient."No, no; you were better employed.You don't have to tell me you had a
nice evening.I see it in your eyes.I see perfectly how the hours
past: that you always had something pleasant to listen to.In the
concert intervals it was a conversation."

Anne half smiled and said, “See that in my eyes?

"Yes.Your face perfectly informs me that you were in
company last night with the person you find most pleasant
the world, the person you are interested in right now more than
all the rest of the world together."

A blush spread over Anne's cheeks.She couldn't say anything."And so being," continued Mrs. Smith, after a short pause, "I
hope you think i know how to appreciate your kindness when coming to
me this morning.It's really very kind of you to come and sit with it
me, when you must have so many nicer requests on your time."

Anne did not hear any of this.She was still amazed and
confusion aroused by her friend's penetration, unable to imagine how
any report from Captain Wentworth could have reached him.After another
short silence ...

"Please," said Mrs. Smith, "is Mr. Elliot aware of your knowledge of
me? Does he know I'm in Bath? "

"Mr. Elliot! Anne repeated, looking up surprised..One moment
the reflection showed her the mistake she had made.She caught it
instantly; and regain your courage with the feeling of security,
soon added, more calmly, "Do you know Mr. Elliot?"

"I knew him a lot," replied Mrs. Smith,
seriously, "but it looks worn out now.It's been a while since we met."

"I was not at all aware of this.You never mentioned it before.Did i have
knew it, I would have had the pleasure to tell him about you."

"To confess the truth," said Mrs. Smith, assuming her usual air of
cheerfulness, "this is exactly the pleasure I want you to have.I want
you tell mr Elliot about me.I want your interest in him.He
can be an essential service for me; and if you had the kindness,
my dear Miss Elliot, to make you an object, of course it is
Finished."

“I should be extremely happy; hope you can not doubt my will to
be of no use to you, Anne replied, but I suspect that
you consider me to have a greater claim on Mr. Elliot, a greater
right to influence it, which it really is.I'm sure you have,
one way or another, imbued with such a notion.You should only think of me as
Mr. Elliot's relationship.If in this light there is something that you
suppose his cousin can ask him, please don't
hesitate to employ me."

Mrs. Smith gave him a penetrating look, then, smiling, said:

"I was a little premature, I perceive it, I beg your pardon.I
should have waited for official information.But now my dear Miss
Elliot, as an old friend give me a hint as to when I can speak.Next week? To be sure by next week, I might have the right to think of everything
settled, and built my own selfish plans on Mr. Elliot's good fortune."

"No," Anne replied, "not next week, not next, not next.I assure you
that nothing of the kind that you can think of will be fixed from one week to the next.I'm not gonna marry Mr. Elliot.I would like to know why you
imagine that I am? "

Mrs. Smith looked at her again, looked at her seriously, smiled, shook her
head, and exclaimed:

"Now how I wish I understood you! How I wish I knew what you
was at! I have a good idea that you don't conceive to be cruel, when
the right time is happening.Until it comes you know we women never
means to have someone.It's a thing of course among us, that every man
is refused, until he offers.But why should you be cruel? Let me plead
for my - current friend I can't call him but for my old friend.Where can you look for a more suitable match? Where can you expect a
more gentleman, pleasant man? Let me recommend Mr. Elliot.I am
you hear nothing but good from him from Colonel Wallis; and who can
do you know him better than Colonel Wallis? "

"My dear Mrs. Smith, Mr. Elliot's wife is not well over half dead.
one year.He shouldn't be supposed to pay his addresses to any
a."

" Oh! if these are your only objections, "cried Mrs. Smith," Mr.
Elliot is safe, and I won't give myself any more trouble about him.Do
don't forget me when you're married that's all.Let her know that i am
a friend of yours, and then he won't think much of trouble
necessary, which is very natural for him now, with so much business
and his own commitments, to be avoided and disposed of as best he can; very
natural, maybe.Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.Of
of course he can't realize how important it is to me.Well, my dear miss
Elliot, I hope and hope you will be very happy.Mr. Elliot makes sense
understand the value of such a woman.Your peace will not be
castaway like mine was.You are safe in all the affairs of the world, and
secure in character.He will not be lost; he will not be
misled by others to his ruin."

“No,” said Anne, “I can easily believe everything from my cousin.He
seems to have a calm and determined temperament, not at all open to dangers
impressions.I consider him with great respect.I have no reason
of everything that comes under my observation, to do otherwise.But I haven't known him for a long time; and he is not a man, I think, to be
known intimately soon.This way of talking about him, Madame
Smith, convince you he's nothing to me? It must surely be calm
sufficient.And, on my word, he's nothing to me.Should he ever
propose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine that he
thought to do), I will not accept it.I assure you I won't.I assure you Mr. Elliot did not have the share you have
assuming, whatever fun the concert last night may offer:
not Mr. Elliot; It's not Mr. Elliot who ... "

She stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much;
but less would hardly have been enough.Mrs. Smith would barely
so early believed in Mr. Elliot's failure, but according to the perception
to be someone else.In fact, she submitted instantly,
and with all the appearance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne, eager to
escape further, was anxious to know why Mrs. Smith should have
believed that she must marry Mr. Elliot; where she could have received the
idea, or who she might have heard it from."Tell me how it came to your mind."

"It first occurred to me," replied Mrs. Smith, "after finding out how much
you were together and thought it was the most likely thing in the
world desired by all who belong to either of you; and you
may depend on it that all your knowledge has disposed of you in
in the same way.But I never heard of it before two days ago."

"And did we actually talk about it?"

"Did you observe the woman who opened the door for you when you called
yesterday?"

"No.Wasn't it Mrs. Speed, as usual, or the maid? I did not observe anyone
in particular."

“It was my friend Mrs. Rooke; nurse Rooke; who, by the way, had an excellent
curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be on the way to let you in.She only left Marlborough Buildings on Sunday; and she was
who told me you had to marry Mr. Elliot.She had had it from Mrs.
Wallis herself, who didn't seem like a bad authority.She sat an hour with
me Monday night, and gave me the whole story." "The totality
story, repeated Anne laughing."She couldn't make a very long
story, I think, of such a small piece of unfounded news."

Mrs. Smith didn't say anything."But," Anne continued, "although there is no truth in my
having this claim on Mr. Elliot, I would be extremely happy to be of
use for you in every way i could.Should I mention your being to her
in the bath? Should I take any message? "

"No, thank you: no, certainly not.In the heat of the moment, and
under a mistaken impression, I might have tried to
interest you in certain circumstances; but not now.No, thank you, I
have nothing to worry about."

"I think you said you knew Mr. Elliot for many years?"

"I did."

"Not before her wedding, I suppose?"

"Yes, he was not married when I first knew him."

"And - did you know a lot?"

"Intimately."

"Indeed! So tell me what he was at that time of life.I have one
great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was when he was very young.Was he
at all as it appears now? "

"I haven't seen Mr. Elliot for three years," replied Ms. Smith,
given so seriously that it was impossible to pursue the subject further;
and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase in curiosity.They were both silent: Mrs. Smith very caring.Finally--

"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot," she cried, naturally.
tone of cordiality, "I beg your pardon for the brief answers I have
I gave you, but I was unsure of what to do.I have
doubted and thought about what I should tell you.The
were there a lot of things to take into account.We hate to be
unofficial, giving bad impressions, doing silly things.Even the
the smooth surface of the family union seems worth preserving, although it may
be nothing lasting below.However, I determined; I think I am
right; I think you should familiarize yourself with the real life of Mr. Elliot
character.Although I am convinced that at present you do not have the
the slightest intention to accept it, there is no saying what can
happen.You might, at one time or another, be affected differently towards
him.Hear the truth, so, now, while you are free from prejudice.m
Elliot is a man with no heart or conscience; a conception, suspicious,
to be cold-blooded, who thinks only of himself; who for his
interest or facility, would be guilty of any cruelty, or treason,
which could be carried out without risk to its general character.He
has no feelings for others.Those for whom it was the main cause of
leading to ruin, he can neglect and desert without the slightest
scruple.It is totally beyond the reach of any feeling of
justice or compassion.Oh! he is black in heart, hollow and black! "

Anne's astonished look and her exclamation of wonder made her stop and
in a calmer way, she added,

"My expressions surprise you.You have to consider a hurt, angry
women.But I will try to control myself.I will not abuse him.I
will only tell you what I found it.The facts speak.It was
the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him, and
believed him to be as good as him.Intimacy had formed before
our marriage.I have found them the most intimate friends; and I too have become
exceedingly satisfied with Mr. Elliot, and had the highest opinion
from him.At nineteen, you know, you don't think very seriously; But
Mr. Elliot appeared to me as good as the others, and much more
pleasant than most, and we were almost always together.We
were mostly in town, living in a very good style.He was then the
inferior in the circumstances; he was then the poor; he had rooms in
the Temple, and that was all he could do to support
of a gentleman.He always had a home with us whenever he chose; he
was always welcome; he was like a brother.My poor Charles, who had
the finest and most generous mind in the world, would have shared his
last penny with him; and I know his purse was open to him; I
know that he often helped him."

"It had to relate to this very period in Mr. Elliot's life," said
Anne, "who has always excited my particular curiosity.He must have
around the same time it became known to my father and sister.I never knew him myself; I have only heard of him; but there was something
in his conduct then, towards my father and my sister, and
then in the circumstances of her marriage, which I never could
completely reconcile with the present tense.It seemed to announce another
kind of man."

"I know everything, I know everything", exclaimed Mrs. Smith.."He had been
introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I knew
him, but I've heard him talk about them forever.I know he was invited and
encouraged, and I know he didn't choose to go.I can satisfy you,
perhaps on points that you would hardly expect; and as for his
marriage, I knew everything at the time.I was aware of all the fors
and against; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and his projects;
and although I did not know his wife before, her inferior situation
in society, indeed, made it impossible, but I knew it all
life afterwards, or at least until the last two years of his life
life, and can answer any question you want to ask."

"No," said Anne, "I have no special inquiries to make about her..I
always understood that they weren't a happy couple.But I would like
to know why, at that time of his life, he would have despised my father
knowledge as he did.My father was certainly willing to take very
kind and appropriate opinion of him.Why did Mr. Elliot back off? "

"Mr. Elliot," replied Mrs. Smith, "at this time of his life had a
object in sight: to make a fortune, and by a process a little faster
than the law.He was determined to succeed by marriage.It was
determined, at least, not to spoil it with an imprudent marriage; and me
to know that was his belief (whether rightly or not, of course I can't
decide), that your father and sister, in their civility and
invitations, designed a match between the heir and the young
lady, and it was impossible that such a correspondence would have replied to her
ideas of wealth and independence.It was his motive to draw
back, I can assure you.He told me the whole story.He had not
cover-ups with me.It was curious to have left you behind
me in Bath, my first and foremost knowledge about marriage should be
your cousin; and that, through him, I would continuously hear
your father and your sister.He described a Miss Elliot, and I thought
very affectionately from each other."

"Perhaps," cried Anne, struck with a sudden idea, "have you sometimes spoken of
me to Mr. Elliot? "

"To be sure I did it; very often.I used to brag about my own Anne Elliot,
and certify that you are a very different creature from ... "

She checked herself just in time."This explains something Mr. Elliot said last night," cried
Anne."That explains it.I found out he was used to hearing from me.I
couldn't understand how.What crazy imaginations we form where dear
me is concerned! How sure to be wrong! But I beg your pardon; I
interrupted you.Did Mr. Elliot then get married completely for money?
The circumstances, probably, which opened your eyes to his
character."

Mrs. Smith hesitated a bit here."Oh! These things are too common.When you live in the world, marrying a man or a woman for money is too
common to hit one as it should.I was very young and associated
only with the young people, and we were a thoughtless and cheerful whole, without any
strict rules of conduct.We lived for fun.I think differently
now; time, illness and grief have given me other notions; but at
this period I must confess, I saw nothing wrong with what Mr. Elliot
was doing."Doing the best for himself", passed as a duty."

"But wasn't she a very low woman?"

" Yes ; what I opposed, but he wouldn't consider.Money, money, it was
all he wanted.His father was a breeder, his grandfather had been
a butcher, but it was nothing.She was a good woman, she had had a
decent education, was put forward by cousins, thrown by chance
in the company of Mr. Elliot, and fell in love with him; and not a
difficulty or a scruples was there on her side, vis-à-vis her
birth.Every precaution was taken to get the actual amount
of his fortune, before committing.Depend on it, no matter what
believes that Mr. Elliot may have for his own situation in current life, as a youngster
man he didn't have the slightest value.His luck for the Kellynch
the estate was something, but all the honor of the family he held to be cheap
like dirt.I have often heard him declare that if the baronets were
salable, anyone should have their own for fifty pounds, weapons and currency,
name and livery included; but I won't pretend to repeat half of what I
used to hear him say about it.It wouldn't be fair; and even
you should have proof, because is all this just a statement, and you
will have proof."

"Indeed, my dear Mrs. Smith, I do not want it", exclaimed Anne.."You have
did not say anything contradictory to what Mr. Elliot appeared to be
years ago.All of this is more of a confirmation of what we used to do
hear and believe.I'm more curious why it should be
different now."

"But to my satisfaction, if you are kind enough to ring for
Married; stay: I am sure you will have the even greater kindness of
go to my room and bring me the little inlaid box
that you will find on the top shelf of the closet."

Anne, seeing her friend seriously bent over her, did what she was
desired.The box was brought and placed in front of her, and Mrs. Smith,
sighing on it as she unlocked it, said--

“It's full of papers belonging to her, to my husband; a little
only part of what i had to watch when i lost it.The letter i
I'm looking for the one Mr. Elliot wrote to him before our wedding,
and turned out to be saved; why, we can hardly imagine.But he was
carefree and unproductive, like other men, about these things; and when
I came to examine his papers, I found him with others even more
trivial, of different people scattered here and there, while many
letters and memoranda of real importance had been destroyed.Here he
is; I wouldn't burn it, because being still very unsatisfied
with Mr. Elliot, I was determined to keep all documents from the old
privacy.I now have another reason to be happy to be able to produce
he."

This was the letter, addressed to "Charles Smith, Esq.Tunbridge Wells ",
and dated London, as far back as July 1803: -

"Dear Smith, I received yours.Your kindness almost dominates
me.I wish nature had made hearts like yours more common, but I
have lived three and twenty years in the world, and have not seen any
he.Right now, believe me, I don't need your services, being in
cash again.Give me joy: I got rid of Sir Walter and Miss.They
went back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them
summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor, to say
me how to bring it with the best hammer advantage.The baronet,
nevertheless, remarrying is not unlikely; he's pretty crazy.If he does, however, they'll leave me alone, which may be decent
equivalent for reversion.He is worse than last year."I wish I had another name than Elliot.I'm fed up.The name of
Walter I can give up, thank goodness! and I wish you never insult me
with my second W.again, which means, for the rest of my life, just being
yours really, - Wm.Elliot."

Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow; and Mrs.
Smith, observing the high color of his face, said:

"The language, I know, is very disrespectful.Although I forgot
the exact terms, I have a perfect idea of ​​the general meaning.But it shows you the man.Mark his professions to my poor husband.Can anything be stronger? "

Anne could not immediately recover from the shock and mortification of
find such words applied to his father.She was forced to remember
that she saw the letter was a violation of the laws of honor, that
no one should be judged or known by such testimonies, that no
private correspondence might attract the attention of others, before it can
regain enough calm to return the letter that it had been
meditate on it, and say--

"Thank you.This is undoubtedly full proof; proof of everything you
were saying.But why do you know us now? "

"I can explain it too", exclaimed Mrs. Smith, smiling.."Can you really?

"Yes.I showed you Mr. Elliot as he was a dozen years ago, and I
go show him what he is now.I can no longer produce written evidence, but
I can give oral testimony as authentic as you want it to be.
wanting now, and what he does now.He is no longer a hypocrite now.He
really wants to marry you.His current attentions to your family are
very sincere: completely from the heart.I will give you my authority: his
friend Colonel Wallis."

“Colonel Wallis! you know him ?

"No.It doesn't come to me in such a direct line as that; he
takes a turn or two, but nothing important.The flow is also good
as at the beginning; the little rubbish it picks up in the detours is easily
distant.Mr. Elliot speaks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis about his
views on you, who said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be, in himself, a
sensitive, prudent and perceptive character; but Colonel Wallis has
a very pretty silly woman, to whom he tells things he would do better
no, and he tells her everything.She in the mind overflowing with
his recovery, repeats everything to his nurse; and the nurse knowing my
acquaintance with you, naturally brings me everything.Monday
evening, my good friend Mrs. Rooke allowed me to penetrate the secrets of
Marlborough Buildings.When I spoke of a whole story, then,
you see i was not as much in love as you assumed."

"My dear Mrs. Smith, your authority is deficient.It won't do.m
Elliot has opinions on me won't account for the
efforts he made to reconcile with my father.That was all
before my arrival in Bath.I found them in the most friendly conditions
when I arrived."

"I know you did; I know it all perfectly well, but--"

"Indeed, Mrs. Smith, we should not expect to obtain real information in such a
a line.The facts or opinions which must pass into the hands of
many, to be misinterpreted by madness in one, and ignorance in another, can
there is hardly much truth left."

"Just give me one audition.You will soon be able to judge the general
credit due, listening to some details that you can on your own
contradict or confirm immediately.Nobody assumes you were his
first incentive.He had seen you indeed, before he came to Bath, and
admire you, but without knowing it's you.So says my historian,
at least.Is it true? Did he see you last summer or fall,
'somewhere in the west', to use his own words, unknowingly
be you? "

"He certainly did.So far it's very true.In Lyme.I happened to be
in Lyme."

“Well,” Mrs. Smith continued, triumphantly, “give my friend credit.
due to the establishment of the first point claimed.He saw you then
in Lyme, and loved you so much that he was extremely happy to meet
with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot, and from there
moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in his visits there.But
there was another one, and one earlier, which I will now explain.If there is
is something in my story that you know to be wrong or
unlikely, stop me.My account says, that your sister's friend, the
the lady who now lives with you, whom I heard you talk about, came to Bath
with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long as September (in short when
they themselves came for the first time) and have stayed there ever since;
that she is an intelligent, insinuating, beautiful, poor and plausible woman,
and quite such in the situation and the manner, to give a general idea,
among Sir Walter's knowledge of his intention to be Lady Elliot, and
in general a surprise that Miss Elliot should apparently be blind to
the danger."

Here Mrs. Smith paused for a moment; but Anne had nothing to say, and she
continued--

“It was the light in which he appeared to those who knew the family,
long before you go back; and Colonel Wallis had his eye on
your father enough to be aware of it, although he did not then visit
at Camden Place; but his esteem for Mr. Elliot gave him an interest in
watch everything that was going on there, and when Mr. Elliot came to Bath
for a day or two, like he did a little before Christmas,
Colonel Wallis made him know the appearance of things, and
relationships start to prevail.Now you have to understand this time
had made a very significant change in Mr. Elliot's opinion as to the
value of a baronette.On all points of blood and connection he is a
completely changed man.Having long had as much money as he could
to spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he has
gradually learns to associate his happiness with the consequence that he is
heir to.I thought this was happening before our knowledge ceased, but
is now a confirmed feeling.He can't stand the idea of ​​not being Mister
William.So you can guess that the news he heard from his
friend couldn't be very nice, and you can guess what he produced;
the resolution to return to Bath as soon as possible, and to
to settle there for a time, in order to renew its old
knowledge, and find a place in the family that could give
him the means of determining the degree of his danger, and of
bypass the lady if he found her material.This has been agreed
between the two friends as the only thing to do; and colonel
Wallis had to help in any way he could.It should be
presented and Mrs. Wallis had to be introduced, and everyone had to
be introduced.Mr. Elliot returned as a result; and on request was
forgiven, as you know, and readmitted to the family; and there he
was its constant object, and its only object (until your arrival added
another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs. Clay.He omitted no
opportunity to be with them, threw himself in their way, called for
every hour; but I don't need to be particular on this subject.You can
imagine what a clever man would do; and with this guide, maybe
remember what you saw him do."

- Yes, said Anne, you don't tell me anything that doesn't agree with what
I have known or I could imagine.There is always something offensive about
details of the trick.Maneuvers of selfishness and duplicity
must never be revolting, but I haven't heard anything that really surprises
me.I know those who would be shocked by such a portrayal of Mr.
Elliot, who would find it hard to believe; but i never have
been satisfied.I always wanted another motive for his conduct
who has appeared.I would like to know his current opinion, as to the
probability of the event he dreaded; if he considers
the danger of decreasing or not."

"Lesser, I understand," replied Mrs. Smith.."He thinks Mrs. Clay
afraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring
proceed as she might in her absence.But as he must be absent
at one point or another I don't see how he can ever be safe while he
she holds her current influence.Mrs Wallis has a funny idea, like
the nurse tells me that must be put in the wedding articles when
you and Mr. Elliot get married, that your father must not marry Mrs. Clay.A
plan, worthy of Mrs. Wallis' understanding in all respects; but my
sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity.'Why, to be sure,
Madam, she said, that wouldn't stop her from marrying someone else.'
And, indeed, to confess the truth, I don't think the nurse, in her heart, is a
very fierce opponent of Sir Walter making a second game.She must
to be allowed to promote marriage, you know; and (since oneself
going to interfere) who can say that she may not have flying visions of
attend the next Lady Elliot, on the recommendation of Mrs. Wallis? "

"I'm very happy to know all of this," said Anne, after a little
thoughtfulness."It will be more painful for me in some ways to be
in the company of him, but I will know better what to do.My line of
driving will be more direct.Mr. Elliot is obviously a lie,
artificial and worldly man, who has never had a better principle for
guide him than selfishness."

But Mr. Elliot was not done with.Mrs. Smith had been blown away
her first direction, and Anne had forgotten, for the sake of her own
family concerns, how many had been originally implicated against him; But
his attention was now drawn to the explanation of these first clues,
and she listened to a recital which, if it did not perfectly justify
Mrs. Smith's unreserved bitterness, proved to him that he had been very
insensitive in his conduct towards her; very deficient both in justice
and compassion.She learned that (the intimacy between them continuing intact by Mr.
Elliot's wedding), they had always been together, and Mr.
Elliot had driven his friend into spending far beyond his fortune.Mrs
Smith didn't want to blame himself and was the most loving of
throw it at her husband; but Anne could perceive that their income
had never lived up to their lifestyle, and that from the start
there had been a lot of general and common extravagance.De
his wife's account of him, she could discern that Mr. Smith was a man
warm feelings, an easy temperament, carefree and not strong habits
understanding, much kinder than his friend, and very different from him,
led by him, and probably despised by him.Mr. Elliot, brought up by his
marriage to great wealth, and willing to any satisfaction of
the pleasure and vanity that could be ordered without getting involved,
(for with all his complacency he had become a prudent man), and
start to be rich, just like his friend should have found himself
to be poor, seemed to have had no concern for this friend
probable finances, but, on the contrary, had prompted and
to encourage expenditure which could only end in ruin; and the Smiths
as a result had been ruined.The husband had died just in time to be spared from the full knowledge of
he.They had already experienced enough embarrassment to try it
the friendship of their friends, and to prove that Mr. Elliot had better
not to be judged; but it was only at his death that the miserable state of
his affairs were well known.With confidence in Mr. Elliot,
more honorable with his feelings than with his judgment, Mr. Smith had
appointed him executor; but Mr. Elliot would not act,
and the difficulties and distress that this refusal had accumulated for him,
in addition to the inevitable suffering of his situation, had been
such as they could not be told without anguish of the mind, or listened to
without corresponding indignation.Anne was shown a few letters from him on occasion, answers to urgent questions
requests from Mrs. Smith, who all breathed the same severity
resolution not to engage in an unsuccessful problem, and, under a cold
civility, the same cruel indifference to one of the evils she
could bring him.It was a horrible image of ingratitude and
inhumanity; and Anne felt, at times, that no blatant crime opened
Could have been worse.She had a lot to listen to; all
details of sad scenes from the past, all the minutiae of distress on
distress, which in previous conversations had only been mentioned, was
now remained with a natural indulgence.Anne could perfectly
understand the exquisite relief, and was all the more inclined to
marvel at the calm of his friend's usual state of mind.There was a circumstance in the story of his grievances of
particular irritation.She had good reason to believe that some
owned by her husband in the West Indies, who had been for many
years under some sort of escrow for the payment of its own
charges, could be recoverable by appropriate measures; and that
property, even if it is not large, would be enough to make it relatively
rich.But there was no one to stir there.Mr. Elliot wouldn't do anything,
and she couldn't do anything herself, also handicapped by
effort by his state of bodily weakness, and employing others by
his lack of money.She had no natural connection to even help him
with their lawyer, and she couldn't afford to buy the assistance
of the law.It was a cruel aggravation of means really put to the test.Feeling that she should be in better circumstances than a little
trouble in the right place could do it, and fear that a delay might be
even weaken his claims, was hard to bear.It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne's good offices.
with Mr Elliot.She had previously, in anticipation of their
marriage, was very afraid of losing her friend because of it; but on
being assured that he could not have made any attempt of this nature, because
he didn't even know she was in Bath, it immediately happened, that
something could be done in his favor by the influence of the woman he
loved, and she had hurriedly prepared to interest Anne's feelings,
to the extent that observances due to Mr. Elliot's character would permit,
when Anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of
all; and as he took away the new hope of
succeed in reaching the object of his first anguish, left him at least the
comfort of telling the whole story in its own way.After listening to this full description of Mr. Elliot, Anne was unable to
but express some surprise that Mrs. Smith spoke of him like this
favorably at the start of their conversation."She had seemed
recommend and congratulate him! "

“My dear,” was Mrs. Smith's response, “there was nothing else to do..I considered your marriage to him certain, although he may not have it yet.
made the offer, and I could no more tell the truth of him, than if he
had been your husband.My heart bled for you like I spoke
joy; and yet he is sensitive, he is pleasant, and with such
woman like you, it was not absolutely hopeless.He was very mean
his first wife.They were miserable together.But she was too ignorant
and dazed with respect, and he had never loved her.I was ready to
I hope you have to do better."

Anne might just admit to herself such a possibility of having
been brought to marry him, as made her shudder at the thought of
misery that must have followed.It was just possible that she could
were persuaded by Lady Russell! And under such a supposition,
what would have been the most miserable, when time had revealed everything too
late?

It was very desirable that Lady Russell should not be mistaken again;
and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,
who wore them for most of the morning was that
Anne was completely free to communicate to her friend all that was relative
to Mrs. Smith, in which her conduct was involved.Chapter 22


Anne went home to think about everything she had heard.At one point, she
feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr. Elliot.There was not
nothing more tenderness due to him.He opposed
Captain Wentworth, in all his unwelcome embarrassment; and evil
of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief he could have had
done, was viewed with unreserved feelings, without perplexity.Pity
for him, it was over.But that was the only point of relief.In each
other respect, looking around, or stepping forward, she saw
more to be wary and to apprehend.She was concerned about the
disappointment and pain would feel Lady Russell; for the
mortifications which must weigh on his father and sister, and
had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing how
avoid one of them.She was very grateful for her own knowledge of
him.She had never considered herself entitled to a reward for not
offend an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here is a reward indeed
gushing out! Mrs. Smith could have told him what no one
else could have done.Could knowledge have been extended by
his family? But it was a futile idea.She must speak to Lady Russell,
tell her, consult her, and after doing her best, wait for the event
as calmly as possible; and after all, her greatest need
calm would be in that part of the mind that could not be
open to Lady Russell; in this flood of anguish and fears that must
be all alone.On returning home, she discovered that she had escaped, as she wished.
see M. Elliot; that he had called and paid them a long morning
visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself, and felt safe, when
she heard he was coming back in the evening."I had no intention of asking her," Elizabeth said, with
affected recklessness, "but he gave so many clues; so said Mrs. Clay, to
less."

"Indeed, I say it.I've never seen nobody in my life spell louder for
an invitation.Poor man! I was really in pain for him; for your
hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems doomed to cruelty."

"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, I'm a little too used to the game to
soon to be overwhelmed by the hints of a gentleman.However, when I found out how
excessively, he regretted that he missed my father this
morning, I gave in immediately, because I will never really forget a
opportunity to reunite him with Sir Walter.They seem so
lots of benefits in company with each other.Everyone behaves like this
pleasantly.Mr. Elliot looks on with so much respect."

"Quite delicious!" cried Mrs. Clay, yet not daring to transform her
eyes towards Anne."Exactly like father and son! Dear Miss Elliot,
can't I say father and son? "

"Oh! I am not imposing any embargo on anyone's words.If you have such
ideas ! But, on my word, I'm barely sensitive to his attentions
to be beyond those of other men."

“My dear Miss Elliot! cried Mrs Clay, raising her hands and eyes,
and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in convenient silence."Well, my dear Penelope, you don't need to be so alarmed about her.I did
invite him, you know.I sent him back with smiles.When i found it
really went to his friends house in Thornberry Park for the whole day
tomorrow I took pity on him."

Anne admired the good play of the friend, being able to show such
pleasure as she did, in expectation and in the actual arrival of
the very person whose presence must really bother her
main object.It was impossible but that Mrs. Clay must hate the sight
by Mr. Elliot; and yet she could take on a very obliging and placid air,
and seem quite satisfied with the reduced license to devote
herself half as much to Sir Walter as she would have
other.For Anne herself, it was very distressing to see Mr. Elliot enter the
bedroom; and quite painful to have approached him and talked to him.She had
been used before to feel that he couldn't always be quite sincere, but
now she saw the insincerity in everything.His attentive deference to her
the father, in contrast to his old language, was odious; and when she
thinking of his cruel behavior towards Mrs. Smith, she could hardly bear
the sight of her present smiles and sweetness, or the sound of her
artificial good feelings.She intended to avoid any change in morals that could cause a
remonstrance on his part.It was a big goal for her to escape it all
inquiry or glare; but it was his intention to be as decidedly cool as
him like this might be compatible with their relationship; and trace, like
quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had
been gradually trained.She was therefore more careful and more
cool, than it had been the day before.He wanted to rekindle his curiosity about how and where he could
heard her once praised; really wanted to be gratified by
more solicitation; but the spell was broken: he found that the heat and
the animation of a public room was necessary to turn on his modest cousin
vanity; he found, at least, that this was not to be done now, by any of the
these attempts that he could risk among the pretensions too
others.He little assumed it was a hot topic now
exactly against his interest, immediately bringing everything to his mind.
the parts of his conduct that were the least excusable.She had some satisfaction to find that he was really coming out of
Bath the next morning, leaving early, and that he would have left on
more than two days.He was invited to Camden Place again on
the very evening of his return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening its
the absence was certain.It was bad enough that a Mrs. Clay was
always in front of her; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their
party, seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.He
was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practiced on
her father and Elizabeth; consider the different sources of
mortification is preparing for it! Mrs. Clay's selfishness was not the case
complicate nor as revolting as his; and Anne would have composed for
marriage at the same time, with all its evils, to be clear from Mr. Elliot
subtleties in trying to prevent it.On Friday morning she intended to go very early to Lady Russell's, and
perform the necessary communication; and she would be gone
directly after breakfast, but that Mrs. Clay was also going out
compelling goal to save her sister from trouble, which determined her to
wait until she is safe from such a companion.She saw Mrs. Clay
far enough away, so before she starts talking to spend the morning
in Rivers Street."Alright," said Elizabeth, "I have nothing to send except my love..Oh!
you might as well take back that boring book she would lend me, and
pretend to have read it.I really can't worry about
always with all the new poems and nation states coming out.Lady Russell bores one with her new posts.You do not need
tell her, but I found her dress ugly the other night.I used
to think she had sartorial tastes, but I was ashamed of her at the
concert.Something so formal and arranged in his tune! and she sits like that
law! My best love, of course."

"And mine," added Sir Walter."Best regards.And you can tell that
I want to call her soon.Make a civil message; but i only go
leave my card.Morning visits are never fair to women when it comes time to
life, who wear so little makeup.If she only wore red
she wouldn't be afraid to be seen; but the last time I called I
observed that the blinds were lowered immediately."

While his father was talking, there was a knock on the door.Who could he
to be? Anne, remembering Mr.
Elliot, would have expected, but for his known engagement seven
miles away.After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of
approach were heard, and "Mr. and Mrs. Charles Musgrove" were introduced
in the room.Surprise was the strongest emotion aroused by their appearance; but Anne
was really happy to see them; and the others weren't so sorry but that
they could put on a decent welcome air; and as soon as he became
clear that these, their closest relations, had not arrived with any
views from the accommodation in this house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were
able to rise in cordiality, and to do very well the honors.They
had come to Bath for a few days with Mrs. Musgrove, and were at
White hart.So much was quickly understood; but until Sir Walter
and Elizabeth walked Mary into the other living room, and
feasting on her admiration, Anne could not rely on
Charles's brain for a regular history of their coming, or a
explanation of some smiling allusions to particular cases, which had
been conspicuously abandoned by Mary, as well as some apparent
confusion over who their party was.She then found that it consisted of Mrs. Musgrove, Henrietta and
Captain Harville, beside themselves.He gave her a very simple,
intelligible record of the whole; a narration in which she saw a great
most characteristic procedural case.The regime had received its
Captain Harville's first impulse to come to Bath
business.He had started talking about it a week ago; and doing
something, as the shooting was over, Charles had offered to come with him,
and Mrs. Harville had seemed to like the idea very much, as
benefit to her husband; but Mary couldn't bear to be left behind, and had
made herself so miserable that for a day or two all
seemed to be pending, or at the end.But then it had been taken back
by his father and mother.Her mother had old friends in Bath who
she wanted to see; we thought it was a good opportunity for Henrietta to
come and buy wedding clothes for her and her sister; and, in short,
it ended up being his mother's day, that all could be
comfortable and easy to Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included
inside for general convenience.They had arrived late at night
before.Mrs Harville, her children and Captain Benwick, stayed with
Mr. Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross.Anne's only surprise was that business should be far enough along
to talk about Henrietta's wedding clothes.She had imagined such
difficulties of fortune to exist there as it is necessary to prevent the marriage
to be at hand; but she learned from Charles that very
recently (since Mary's last letter to herself), Charles Hayter had
been asked by a friend to make a living for a young man who could not
maybe claim it in many years; and that on the strength of his
current income, with almost a certainty of something more permanent
long before the term in question, the two families had consented to the
the wishes of young people and that their marriage is likely to take place
in a few months, as soon as Louisa."And a very good life
was, "Charles added:" just five and twenty miles from Uppercross, and
in a beautiful country: beautiful part of Dorsetshire.In the center of
some of the best preserves in the kingdom, surrounded by three large
owners, all more attentive and jealous than the others; and two
of the three at least, Charles Hayter could get a special
recommendation.Not that he'll like it as it should, ”he observed,
"Charles is so cool with sports.This is the worst of him."

"I am extremely happy, indeed," cried Anne, "particularly happy that this
should happen; and that of two sisters, who both equally deserve,
and who have always been such good friends, the pleasant prospect of
one shouldn't tone down those of the other - they should be
equal in their prosperity and comfort.I hope your father and mother
are quite satisfied with both."

"Oh yes.My father would be very happy if the gentlemen were
richer, but he has no other fault to find.The money, you know, comes
with money - two girls at a time - it can't be a very pleasant one
operation, and that tightens it on a lot of things.However, I do not
means that they are not entitled to it.It's very fit, they should
have daughters' shares; and I'm sure he's always been very kind,
liberal father for me.Mary doesn't like Henrietta's game more than half.She never did, you know.But she don't do him justice, nor think
enough about Winthrop.I can't make him pay attention to the value of the
property.It's a very fair game over time; and i liked
Charles Hayter all my life, and I won't stop now."

"Parents as excellent as Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove," exclaimed Anne,
"should be happy in the marriages of their children.They do everything for
confers happiness, I'm sure.What a blessing for young people to be
those hands! Your father and mother seem so totally free from it all
ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery,
both young and old.I hope you think Louisa has recovered perfectly
now?"

He answered hesitantly: “Yes, I believe so; very
restored; but it is altered; there is no running or jumping, no
laugh or dance; it's very different.If he only happens to
closes the door a little tight, she jumps and squirms like a young
dab-chick in water; and Benwick sits on his elbow, reading verses,
or whisper to him, all day."

Anne couldn't help but laugh."This may not be much to your liking, I
know, she said, but I think he's an excellent young man."

"To be sure he is.No one doubts it; and i hope you don't think i am
so illiberal as to want each man to have the same objects and
pleasures like me.I have great value for Benwick; and when we
can only make him talk, he has a lot to say.His reading did
no harm, because he fought as well as read.He's a good boy.I got to know him more last Monday than ever before.We
had a famous rat-hunting series all morning in the great
barns; and he played his role so well that I liked him better
since."

Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles
follow others to admire the mirrors and porcelain; but Anne had heard
enough to understand the current state of Uppercross and rejoice
his happiness ; and although she sighed in rejoicing, her sigh had no
of the ill will of the envy in her.She would certainly have achieved their
blessings if she could, but she didn't want to diminish theirs.The visit took place in a good mood.Mary was in
excellent minds, enjoying the mirth and the change, and so good
satisfied with the trip in her stepmom's car with four
horses, and with its own complete independence from Camden Place, which
she was in exactly the mood to admire everything the way she should, and
enter more easily into all the superiorities of the house, because they
have been detailed to him.She had no demands on her father or sister, and
its consequence was just increased enough by their beauty
lounges.Elizabeth suffered a lot for a short time.She felt that
Mrs. Musgrove and her whole group should be invited to dinner with them; But
she couldn't stand having the difference in style, the reduction of
servants whom a dinner must betray, witnesses of those who had been
still inferior to the Kellynch Elliots.It was a struggle
between decorum and vanity; but vanity got the best, and then
Elizabeth was happy again.These were his internal beliefs: "Old
shaped notions; the hospitality of the country; we do not pretend to give
dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does; not even
asks his own sister's family, although they have been here for a month: and I dare
to say that it would be very embarrassing for Mrs Musgrove; put her completely out of
his path.I'm sure she would prefer not to come; she can't feel easy
with us.I'll ask them all for an evening; it will be much better;
it will be a novelty and a treat.They haven't seen two of these
front lounges.They will be happy to come tomorrow
evening.It will be a regular party, small, but the most elegant."And
this satisfied Elizabeth: and when the invitation was given to both
present, and promised for those absent, Marie was also fully satisfied.She was especially invited to meet Mr. Elliot and be introduced to Lady
Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, who were fortunately already engaged to
come; and she couldn't have received more rewarding attention.Miss Elliot was to have the honor of appealing to Mrs. Musgrove in the
morning class; and Anne walked away with Charles and Mary, to go
and see her and Henrietta directly.His plan to sit with Lady Russell must give way for now.The three of them called Rivers Street for a few minutes; But
Anne convinced herself that a day of delay in the planned communication
could be of no consequence, and hastened to the White Hart, to
revisit friends and companions from last fall, with a
eagerness of benevolence that many associations have helped to form.They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter inside, and by themselves, and
Anne had the warmest welcome from everyone.Henrietta was exactly in this
state of newly improved views, of newly formed happiness, which made
her full of respect and concern for all those she had loved before
at all; and Mrs. Musgrove's true affection had been won by her
useful when they were in distress.It was cordiality and a
warmth, and a sincerity which Anne rejoiced all the more for
lack of such blessings at home.She was begged to give them so much
of his time as possible, invited for all days and all day, or
rather claimed to be part of the family; and, in return, she naturally
fell into all his usual ways of attention and assistance, and on
Charles left them together, listened to Mrs Musgrove's speech
Louisa's story, and to Henrietta herself, giving opinions on
business and recommendations to stores; with intervals of each help
that Mary demanded, from changing her ribbon to settling her accounts;
to find his keys, and to match his trinkets, to try to
convince her that she was not mistreated by anyone; that Marie, well
amused as she usually was, in her post at a window overlooking the
the entrance to the Pump Room, could only have its moments of imagination.It was to be expected a morning of deep confusion.A big party at
a hotel ensured an unstable and changing scene.One five minutes
brought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne hadn't been there half a century
hour, when their dining room, spacious as it was, appeared more than half
filled: a group of old stable friends sat around Mrs Musgrove,
and Charles returned with Captains Harville and Wentworth.the
the appearance of the latter could only be the surprise of the
moment.It was impossible for him to have forgotten to feel that this
the arrival of their mutual friends should soon bring them together
again.Their last meeting had been the most important to open his
feelings; she had derived a delicious conviction from it; but she
feared in his eyes that the same unhappy persuasion, which had
threw him out of the concert hall, still governed.He does not have
seem to want to be close enough for a conversation.She tried to be calm and let things take their course, and tried
insist a lot on this argument of rational dependence: - "Surely, if
there is a constant attachment on each side, our hearts must understand
each other before long.We're not a boy and a girl, to be captivating
irritable, deceived by the inattention of every moment, and playing for no reason
with our own happiness."And yet, a few minutes later, she felt
as if they were in each other's company, in their present
circumstances, could only expose them to inadvertence and
misinterpretations of the most mischievous."Anne," cried Mary, still at her window, there is Mrs. Clay, I'm sure,
standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.I saw them
turn the corner of Bath Street later.They seemed to be in the middle of a conversation.Who is it? Come and tell me.God's goodness! I remember.It is M.
Elliot himself."

- No, cried Anne quickly, it can't be Mr. Elliot, I assure you..He
was due to leave Bath at nine this morning, and is only returning
tomorrow."

As she spoke, she felt Captain Wentworth looking at her, the
whose conscience upset and embarrassed her, and made her regret
that she had said so much, as simple as it is.Mary, annoyed at being supposed not to know her own cousin,
started talking very warmly about family traits and protesting
even more positively that it was Mr. Elliot, again calling Anne to
come and look for herself, but Anne did not want to move, and tried to
be cool and indifferent.His distress returned, however, upon perceiving
smiles and smart looks pass between two or three of the lady
visitors, as if they believed themselves completely in the secret.It was
obvious that the noise about her had spread, and a short pause
successful, which seemed to guarantee that it would now spread further."Come on, Anne," cried Mary, "come and look at you.you will also be
late if you don't rush.They are separating ; they shake
hands.He turns away.I don't know Mr. Elliot, indeed! You seem
I forgot everything about Lyme."

To appease Mary, and perhaps to shield her own embarrassment, Anne has moved
quietly at the window.She was just in time to make sure she
was really Mr. Elliot, which she had never believed, before he
disappeared on one side, while Mrs. Clay quickly walked away on the other;
and controlling the surprise she couldn't help but feel
appearance of friendly conference between two people totally
opposite interest, she calmly said, "Yes, it's Mr. Elliot, certainly.He changed his start time, I guess that's it, where I might be
I'm wrong, I might not attend; "and returned to his chair,
recomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted
good.The visitors took their leave; and Charles, having seen them civilly
goes away, then made a face at them and insulted them because they had come, started
with--

"Well mama I did something for you that you will like.I
went to the theater, and got a box for tomorrow night.Ant
I'm a good boy? I know you like a play; and there is room for all of us.He owns nine.I hired Captain Wentworth.Anne will not be
sorry to join us, I'm sure.We all love to play.Did i not do
well, mom? "

Mrs. Musgrove began with good humor to express her perfect
preparation for the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when
Mary interrupted him eagerly, exclaiming:

"My God, Charles! How can you think of such a thing? Take a box
for tomorrow night! Did you forget we're engaged to Camden
Place tomorrow night? and that we were specifically asked to meet
Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr. Elliot, and all the major
family ties, on purpose to be presented to them? How can you be
so forgetful? "

"Phoo! Phoo!" replied Charles, "what is a party? Never worth it
remember.Your father could have invited us to dinner, I think, if he
wanted to see us.You can do whatever you want, but I'll go to
to play."

"Oh! Charles, I declare that it will be too abominable if you do, when you
promised to go."

"No, I didn't promise.I only smiled and waved, and said the word
'happy.'There was no promise."

"But you have to go, Charles.It would be unforgivable to fail.We were
expressly requested to be introduced.There was always such a big
connection between the Dalrymples and us.Nothing ever happened
on either side that was not immediately announced.We are very close
relationships, you know; and Mr. Elliot too, whom you owe so particularly
to know ! All attention is due to Mr. Elliot.Consider,
my father's heir: the future representative of the family."

"Don't talk to me about heirs and representatives," cried Charles.."I
am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rise
Sun.If I wouldn't go for your dad, I should think so
scandalous to go for his heir.What does Mr. Elliot mean to me? "
The carefree expression was the life of Anne, who saw this captain
Wentworth was all attentive, watching and listening with all his soul;
and that the last words brought his inquisitive eyes from Charles to
se.Charles and Mary always spoke in the same style; him, half serious
and half joking, now the diagram of the room, and she,
invariably serious, opposing it very strongly, and not failing to
she knew that, even determined to make it to Camden Place herself, she
shouldn't think they were used very well, if they went piecemeal
without her.Mrs. Musgrove intervened."We better put it off until later.Charles, you better go back and
change the box for Tuesday.It would be a shame to be divided, and we
should also lose Miss Anne if there is a party at her father's house;
and I'm sure neither Henrietta nor I should care about the room at all,
if Miss Anne couldn't be with us."

Anne really felt obligated for this kindness; and just as much
for the opportunity she gave him to say resolutely:

"If it only depended on my inclination, ma'am, the house party
(except on behalf of Marie) would not be the slightest obstacle.I
have no fun in the kind of meeting, and should be too happy to
change it for a play, and with you.But, you better not be
tempted, maybe.“She had said so; but she was shaking when it was
done, aware that his words have been heard, and not even daring
try to observe their effect.It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday was to be the day; Charles
only reserving the advantage of teasing his wife again, by persisting
that he would go to the play tomorrow if no one else wanted.Captain Wentworth left his seat and walked towards the fireplace; Probably
for the pleasure of getting away from it soon after, and taking a
station, with a less naked design, by Anne.“You haven't been in Bath long enough,” he said, “to enjoy the evening.
the festivals of the place."

"Oh no.Their habitual character has nothing to me.I'm not
card player."

"You weren't once, I know.You didn't like the cards; But
time makes a lot of changes."

"I'm not so much changed yet," Anne cried, and stopped, fearing that she
hardly knew what mistake.After waiting a few moments he said,
and as if it was the result of an immediate feeling, "It's a period,
Indeed! Eight and a half is a period."

Whether he would have gone further was left to Anne's imagination.
meditate at a quieter hour; because while still hearing the sounds he
had pronounced, she was surprised by Henrietta, eager to
take advantage of the leisure activities available to go out and call on her
companions not to waste time, lest someone else come in.They were forced to move.Anne spoke of being perfectly ready, and
tried to watch it; but she felt that Henrietta could have known the
the regret and reluctance of his heart to leave that chair, to prepare
to leave the room, she would have found, in all her own sensations for
her cousin, in the very security of her affection, with pity
her.Their preparations, however, were halted short.Alarming sounds were
heard; other visitors approached, and the door was opened for Sir
Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give a general thrill.Anne felt instant tightness, and everywhere she looked she saw symptoms
of the same.The comfort, the freedom, the cheerfulness of the room were
finished, stifled in cold calm, determined silence or insipid conversation,
meet the heartless elegance of father and sister.How? 'Or' What
mortifying to feel that it was so!

His jealous eye was satisfied on one point.Captain Wentworth was
recognized again by everyone, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.She even addressed him once and looked at him more than once.Elizabeth was in fact turning to a great extent.The following
explained it.After wasting a few minutes saying the right one
nothing, she began to launch the invitation which should include all
the remaining rights of the Musgroves."Tomorrow night, to meet a few
friends: no formal party.“Everything has been said very graciously, and the
cards which she had obtained, the "Miss Elliot in the house",
were placed on the table, with a courteous and understanding smile to all,
and a smile and a more decidedly card for Captain Wentworth.the
the truth was that Elizabeth had been in Bath long enough to understand
the importance of a man with an air and appearance like his.The past
it was nothing.The present was that Captain Wentworth would move
good in his living room.The card was conspicuously given, and Sir Walter
and Elizabeth got up and disappeared.The interruption had been short, though severe, and the ease and animation
returned to most of those they left as the door closed them, but not
to Anne.She could only think of the invitation she had with such a
astonishment seen, and the way it had been
received; a way of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather than
gratification, polite recognition rather than acceptance.It
knew him; she saw disdain in his eyes, and couldn't dare to believe
that he had decided to accept such an offering, as an atonement for
all the insolence of the past.His spirits sank.He was holding the card in
his hand after they're gone, like they're thinking deeply about it."Just think of Elizabeth, including everyone!" whispered Marie very
audible."I'm not surprised that Captain Wentworth is delighted! You see he
cannot remove the card from his hand."

Anne caught his eye, saw her cheeks glow and her mouth forming
in a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away, that she
could neither see nor hear anymore to upset her.The party broke up.The gentlemen had their own activities, the ladies
went about their own business, and they no longer met while Anne
belonged to them.She was urged to come back and have dinner, and
give them all the rest of the day, but his wits had been so long
exercised that at present she felt uneven to more, and just to
at home, where she could be sure to be as quiet as she wanted.Promising to be with them all morning the next day,
this is why she closed the fatigue of the present by a painful walk
Camden Place, there to spend the evening mainly listening to the
Elizabeth and Mrs. Clay's busy arrangements for the next day's party, the
frequent counting of people invited, and
improving the detail of all the embellishments that were to make it the
the most elegant of its kind in Bath, while pestering each other
with the endless question, whether Captain Wentworth would come
or not? They took it for granted, but with her it was a
a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together.It
usually thought he would come, as she usually thought he
should; but it was a case that she couldn't turn into something positive
act of duty or discretion, as inevitably to challenge the suggestions of
very opposite feelings.She only woke up from the rumor of this incessant agitation,
to let Ms Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot for three hours
after being supposed to be out of Bath, for looking in vain
for an indication of the interview of the lady herself, she
determined to mention it, and it seemed to her that there was some guilt about Ms.
Clay's face as she listened.It was transitory: erased in a
instant; but Anne could imagine reading the consciousness of
having, by some complication of a mutual cunning, or some authoritarian
his authority, was obliged to attend (perhaps for half an hour) at
his lectures and restrictions on his designs on Sir Walter.It
cried, however, with a very tolerable imitation of nature:

"Oh dear! Very true.Just think, Miss Elliot, to my surprise, I
met Mr. Elliot in Bath Street.I have never been so surprised.He
turned around and walked with me to the Pump Yard.He had been prevented
leaving for Thornberry, but I really forget what; because I was in a
in a hurry, and I couldn't attend much, and I can only vouch for its being
determined not to delay his return.He wanted to know how
early it could be admitted tomorrow.It was full of "tomorrow", and
it is obvious that I have been full of them too, since I
walked into the house and learned the extension of your plan and all that
had happened, or that I was seeing it could never have been so completely out of
my head."



Chapter 23


Only a day had passed since Anne's conversation with Mrs. Smith; but one
a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so untouched by Mr.
Elliot's conduct, except by its shift effects, which he became
obvious the next morning, always to postpone its explanation
visit to Rivers Street.She had promised to be with the Musgroves of
breakfast at dinner.His faith was sorrowful and Mr. Elliot's
character, like the head of the Sultana Scheherazade, must live a different
day.However, she couldn't keep her date on time; the weather was
unfavorable, and she had cried rain on her friends
count, and felt it on her own, before she could
try to walk.When she reached the White Hart and walked over to
the suitable apartment, she did not find herself or arrive quite on time,
nor the first to arrive.The party before she was, Mrs. Musgrove,
speak to Mrs. Croft and Captain Harville at Captain Wentworth; and
she immediately learned that Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait,
was out by the time it had faded, but would be back soon,
and that the strictest injunctions had been left to Ms Musgrove to
keep her there until they come back.She just had to submit, sit down,
to be composed outwardly, and to feel immersed at the same time in all the
agitations which she had contented herself with tasting
before closing in the morning.There was no delay, no waste of time.It
was immersed in the happiness of such misery, or the misery of such
happiness, instantly.Two minutes after entering the room, the captain
Wentworth said:

"We will write the letter we were talking about, Harville, now, if you
will give me some material."

The equipment was close at hand, on a separate table; he went there, and almost
with his back to them all, was absorbed by the writing.Ms Musgrove was giving Ms Croft the story of her eldest daughter
engagement, and just on that annoying tone of voice
perfectly audible as he pretended to be a whisper.Anne felt that
she was not part of the conversation, and yet, as Captain Harville
seemed thoughtful and unwilling to speak, she couldn't help hearing
many unwanted details; such as "how Mr. Musgrove and my brother
Hayter had met again and again to talk about it; what my brother Hayter
had said one day, and what Mr. Musgrove had proposed the next day, and what
had occurred to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished,
and what I said at the beginning, I could never consent, but after
persuaded to think could very well do, and many in the same
open-hearted communication style: minutiae which, even at every
advantage of taste and delicacy, which the good Mrs. Musgrove could not
to give, could only be really interesting for the main.Mrs. Croft
attended with a lot of good humor, and whenever she spoke at all, she
was very reasonably.Anne hoped that the gentlemen would each be too
busy hearing."And so, ma'am, all that considered," said Ms Musgrove, in her
powerful whisper, "although we could have wished it different, yet,
overall we didn't think it was fair to stand out any longer because
Charles Hayter was pretty crazy about it, and Henrietta was pretty close
as bad; and so we figured they'd better get married at the same time, and do the
the best, as many others have done before them.Anyway, I say,
it will be better than a long engagement."

"This is precisely what I was going to observe," exclaimed Mrs. Croft.."I
prefers young people to settle on a small income at a time, and
having to struggle with some difficulties together, than to get involved in
a long commitment.I still think no mutual ... "

"Oh! Dear Mrs. Croft, "cried Mrs. Musgrove, unable to let her finish him off.
speech, "there is nothing that I abhor so much for young people
commitment.This is what I have always protested against for my children.He
it's very good, I said, that young people get involved, if
there is a certainty of being able to get married in six months, or
even out of twelve; but a long commitment ... "

"Yes, dear madam," said Mrs. Croft, "or an uncertain engagement, a
engagement which can be long.Start without knowing that such
the time that there will be the means to get married, I want to be very dangerous and
reckless, and what I think all parents should prevent as much as they can."

Anne found unexpected interest here.She felt his application to
herself, felt it in a nervous shudder all around her; and at the same
moment when his eyes instinctively looked towards the distant table,
Captain Wentworth's quill stopped moving, his head snapped up, stopping,
listening, and he turned the next moment to take a look, a
quick and conscious look at her.The two ladies continued to speak, to reaffirm the same admitted truths,
and apply them with such examples of the detrimental effect of an opposite
practice as it was in their observation, but Anne did not hear anything
distinctly; it was just a buzz of words in his ear, his mind was in
confusion.Captain Harville, who had in truth heard none of this, is now gone
his seat, and moved to a window, and Anne appearing to watch him, however
it was through total absence of mind, gradually became sensitive that he
invited him to join him where he was standing.He looked at her with a
smile, and a small movement of the head which expressed: "Come to me, I
have something to say; "and easy and unaffected kindness
which denoted the feelings of an acquaintance older than he really was,
strongly applied the invitation.She woke up and went to him.The window he was standing at was across the room from
where the two ladies were seated, and although closer to the captain
Wentworth's table, not very close.As she joined him, the captain
Harville's face returned to the serious, thoughtful expression.
which seemed his natural character."Look here," he said, unfolding a package in his hand and pointing to a
small miniature painting, "do you know who it is?"

"Certainly: Captain Benwick."

"Yes, and you might guess who it is.But, "(in a serious tone)," it was
not made for her.Miss Elliot, do you remember our walk together to
Lyme, and cry for him? I thought little then - but whatever.This was drawn in Cape Town.He met a young intelligent German artist
in Cape Town, and in accordance with a promise made to my poor sister, sat down
him, and brought him home for her; and I am now in charge of
get it properly set for another! It was a commission for me! But
who else was he there to employ? I hope I can allow him.I'm not
sorry, indeed, to move on to another.He undertakes this; "(looking
to Captain Wentworth,) "he writes about it now."And with a
With trembling lips, he finished the whole thing by adding: "Poor Fanny!"
did not forget it so soon! "

"No," Anne replied in a low sensitive voice.."That I can easily
believe."

"It was not in his nature.She adored him."

"It wouldn't be the nature of a woman who really loves."

Captain Harville smiled, as much as to say, "Are you claiming this for your
sex? "and she answered the question, smiling too," Yes.We certainly
don't forget yourself as soon as you forget us.Maybe it's our fate
rather than our merit.We can't help each other.We live at home,
calm, confined, and our feelings attack us.You have to
effort.You still have a profession, activities, certain affairs
sort or other, to immediately plunge you back into the world, and
continued occupation and change soon weaken impressions."

"Granting your assertion that the world is doing it all so early for men
(which, however, I do not think to grant), it does not apply to
Benwick.He was not forced to any effort.Peace has turned
him down right now, and he's been living with us, in our
small family circle since."

- It is true, said Anne, very true; I didn't remember; but what will we do
say now, Captain Harville? If the change doesn't come from outside
circumstances, it must come from within; it must be nature, the nature of man,
who did the trick for Captain Benwick."

"No, no, that's not the nature of man.I won't let it be the man anymore
a woman's nature to be inconstant and to forget those she loves, or
we love you.I believe the opposite.I believe in a real analogy
between our bodily frames and our mind; and that as our bodies are
the stronger our feelings are too; able to take most rough
use and driving in the heaviest weather."

"Your feelings may be the strongest," Anne replied, "but the same
the spirit of analogy will allow me to affirm that ours are the most
tender.The man is stronger than the woman, but he no longer lives;
which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.No, it would be too hard for you if it were any other way.You have
difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.You
are always industrious and industrious, exposed to all risks and difficulties.Your house, your country, your friends, everything has left.Neither time nor health,
nor life, we call yours.It would be hard, indeed "(with a
failing voice), "if the woman's feelings were added to all this."

"We will never agree on this issue," said Captain Harville
began to say, when a slight noise drew their attention to the captain
Wentworth's hitherto perfectly calm division.It was
nothing more than his quill had fallen; but Anne was surprised
to find him closer than she had expected, and half inclined to
suspects that the enclosure had fallen only because it had been occupied by
them, trying to pick up sounds that she didn't think he could
have caught."Have you finished your letter? Said Captain Harville."Not quite, a few more lines.I will have done in five minutes."

"There is no rush on my side.I'm only ready when you are.I am
in a very good anchorage here, "(smiling at Anne,)" well supplied, and
want nothing.Not in a rush for a signal.Well, Miss Elliot, "
(lowering her voice,) "Like I said, we'll never agree, I guess,
on this point.No man or woman would, probably.But let me
observe that all the stories are against you - all the stories, the prose and
verse.If I had a memory like Benwick, I could bring you fifty
quotes in a moment from my side the argument, and I don't think I
never opened a book in my life that had nothing to say about
inconstancy of woman.Songs and proverbs, all about women
inconstancy.But maybe you will say it was all written by men."

"Maybe I will.Yes, yes, please, no reference to examples in
books.Men got all the advantages of us by telling their own story.Education was theirs to a much higher degree; the pen was
in their hands.I won't allow the books to prove anything."

“But how will we prove something?

"We never will.We can never expect to prove anything on such
point.It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.We each start, probably, with a little prejudice towards our own gender; and
on this bias, construct all the circumstances in favor of the one who has
happened in our own circle; including many circumstances (maybe
these same cases which strike us most) may be precisely such that
cannot be put forward without betraying a trust, or in certain
respect by saying what not to say."

"Ah!" cried Captain Harville in a tone of strong feeling, if I could
but make you understand what a man suffers when he takes one last look at
his wife and children, and watch over the boat he sent them
while he's in sight, then turns away and says, `` God knows
if we will ever see each other again! And then if I could pass it on to you
gleam of his soul when he sees them again; when, coming back after a
the absence of twelve months, perhaps, and obliged to put in another port,
he calculates how long it will be possible to get them there, pretending to
be wrong, and saying, "They cannot be here until such a day", but
while hoping for them twelve hours earlier, and seeing them
finally arrive, as if Heaven had given them wings, many hours ago
again! If I could explain it all to you, and all that a man can take
and to do, and glories to do, because of these treasures of his
existence! I only speak, you know, of men who have a heart! "
squeezing his with emotion."Oh!" cried Anne eagerly, "I hope to do justice to all that is felt by
you, and by those who look like you.God forbid that I should
underestimate the warm and faithful feelings of one of my
similar! I should deserve total contempt if I dared
suppose that true attachment and steadfastness was known only to the woman.No, I believe you capable of everything great and good in your husband
Lives.I believe that you are equal in every major effort, and in every
domestic abstention, as long as - if I can afford
expression - as long as you have an object.I mean while the woman you
love lives and live for you.All the privilege that I claim for my own
sex (it is not very enviable; it should not be coveted), it is that of
love the longest, when existence or when hope is gone."

She could not have immediately said another sentence; his heart was
too full, his breath too oppressed."You are a good soul," cried Captain Harville, putting his hand on him.
arm, affectionately enough."There is no quarrel with you.And
when I think of Benwick my tongue is tied."

Their attention was drawn to others.Mrs. Croft was taking
to leave."Here, Frederick, you and I are going our separate ways, I believe," she said.."I am
go home, and you have a commitment with your friend.Tonight we
can have the pleasure of all meeting at your party "(turning to
Anne.) "We got your sister's card yesterday, and I got it
Frédéric also had a card, but I did not see it; and you are
disengaged, Frederic, is not it, as well as us?

Captain Wentworth was folding a letter in a hurry, and either
couldn't or wouldn't answer completely.“Yes,” he said, “very true; here we go our separate ways, but Harville and I go
soon after you; that is, Harville, if you're ready I'm in half a
minute.I know you won't be sorry that you left.I will be at your
service in half a minute."

Mrs. Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letter
with great swiftness, was indeed ready, and even had a hurry, restless
the air, which showed impatience to be gone.Anne didn't know how
understand it.She had the sweetest "Hello, God bless you!" of
Captain Harville, but not a word or a look from him! he had spent
out of the room without a glance!

However, she only had time to approach the table where he had.
written, when footsteps were heard coming back; the door opened, he
was himself.He begged their forgiveness, but he had forgotten his gloves,
and immediately crossing the room towards the writing table, he took out a
letter from under the scattered paper, placed it in front of Anne with
incandescent pleas hung on her for a while, and hastily gathered her
gloves, was out of the room again, almost before Mrs. Musgrove knew
of his being inside: the work of an instant!

The revolution that an instant had made in Anne was almost beyond
expression.The letter, with a barely legible meaning, to "Miss A.IS.-, "was obviously the one he had folded so quickly.While he was supposed to write only to Captain Benwick, he had also been
address her! On the content of this letter depended all that
the world could do for her.Everything was possible, everything could be
challenged rather than suspense.Mrs. Musgrove had few arrangements of
his at his own table; to their protection, she must have confidence, and
sinking into the chair he had occupied, succeeding the very
the place where he had leaned and written, his eyes devoured the following
words:


"I can't listen in silence anymore.I must speak to you by such means
as are within my reach.You pierce my soul.I'm half agony, half
hope.Don't tell me I'm too late, that feelings so precious are
gone forever.I offer myself to you again with an even more toned heart
clean that when you almost broke it eight and a half years ago.Dare
not to say that the man forgets earlier than the woman, that his love has a
premature death.I only loved you.I may be unfair
I've been weak and resentful, but never fickle.You alone have
brought me to Bath.For you alone I think and plan.Do not you have
seen that? Can you not have understood my wishes? I did not have
waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think
you must have penetrated mine.I can barely write.I am every moment
hear something that overwhelms me.You lower your voice, but I can
distinguish the tones of this voice when they would be lost on others.Too good, too excellent creature! You do us justice, indeed.You do
believe that there is a real attachment and consistency in men.Believe
he must be the most fervent, the most constant, in fa.IN.“I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I will come back here, or follow
your party, as soon as possible.One word, one look will suffice to
decide if I go into your father's house tonight or never."


Such a letter was not soon to be retrieved from.A half hour
solitude and reflection could have calmed her; but the ten
only minutes passed now before it was interrupted, with all the
restrictions of his situation, could do nothing for the tranquility.Instead, every moment brought a new stir.It was overwhelming
joy.And before she passed the first full stage
sensation, Charles, Mary and Henrietta all walked in.The absolute necessity of appearing as itself then produces a
immediate struggle; but after a while she couldn't take it anymore.She began
did not understand a word they said, and was forced to plead
indisposition and apologize.They could then see that she looked
very sick, were shocked and worried, and would not move without it
for the world.It was awful.Would they just be gone, and
had left her quietly in possession of this room, it would have been her
cure; but having them all standing or waiting around her was
distracting and in desperation she said she would come home."By all means, my dear," cried Mrs. Musgrove, "go straight home, and
take care of yourself, be in good shape for the evening.I wish
Sarah was there to treat you, but I'm not a doctor myself.Charles, ring
and order a chair.she must not walk."

But the chair would never do.Worst of all! Losing the opportunity
to say two words to Captain Wentworth during his silence,
lonely progress in the city (and she felt almost certain to meet
him) could not be supported.The chair was strongly protested against,
and Mrs. Musgrove, who only thought of some sort of illness, having
made sure with some concern that there had not been a fall in the
Case; that Anne had never slipped and received a blow
on his head; that she was perfectly convinced she hadn't had a fall;
could part ways with her happily, and depend on finding her better at
night.Anxious not to omit any possible precaution, Anne struggled and said:

"I'm afraid, ma'am, that this is not fully understood.You're welcome
good than mentioning to other gentlemen that we hope to see your
whole party tonight.I'm afraid there was a mistake; and
I especially wish you to assure Captain Harville and Captain
Wentworth, that we hope to see them both."

"Oh! My darling, it's understood, I give you my word.Captain
Harville has no other thought than to go."

"Do you think so? But I'm scared ; and i should be so sorry.Do you promise to mention it when you see them again? You will be
see them both this morning, dare I say.Promise me."

"To be sure I will, if you wish.Charles, if you see the captain
Harville anywhere, don't forget to give Miss Anne's message.But indeed,
my dear you don't need to be worried.Captain Harville stands quite
engaged, I will answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare
say."

Anne couldn't take it any longer; but her heart prophesied misfortune to wet
the perfection of its bliss.It couldn't be very durable though..Even if he didn't come to Camden Place himself, it would be in her
power to send a sentence intelligible by Captain Harville.Another
a momentary annoyance has occurred.Charles, in his real and good concern
nature, would go home with her; there was no way to stop him.It was
almost cruel.But she couldn't be ungrateful for long; he sacrificed
an engagement with a gunsmith, to be useful to him; and she left
with him, without any feeling but apparent gratitude.They were on Union Street, when a quicker step back, something
his familiar, gave him two moments of preparation for the sight of
Captain Wentworth.He joined them; but, as if it was uncertain whether
join or pass, nothing said, only watched.Anne could order
herself enough to receive that look, and not disgustingly.Cheeks
that had been pale now shone, and the movements that had hesitated
have been decided.He walked by her side.Currently hit by a blow
thought, said Charles ...

"Captain Wentworth, where are you going? Only on Gay Street, or
further into town? "

"I barely know," replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.."Are you going as high as Belmont?" Are you going near Camden Place?
'Cause if you are, I'll have no qualms asking you to take my
place, and give your arm to Anne at her father's door.it is rather done
for this morning, and I must not go this far without help, and I must
be with this guy in the market place.He promised me the sight of a
capital weapon that he will just send; said he would keep it
unpacked at the last possible moment, so that I can see it; and if I do
not go back now i have no chance.By its description, a good deal
like my second double size cannon, with which you shot one day
Winthrop round."

There could be no objection.There could only be the most suitable
eagerness, a most restrictive respect for the public's view; and controlled smiles
in and spirits dance in private rapture.In half a minute Charles
was at the bottom of Union Street again, and the other two
together: and soon enough words had passed between them to decide
their direction towards the relatively calm and withdrawn gravel
walk, where the power of conversation would make the hour present a
blessing and prepare her for all the immortality that the
the happiest memories of their own future life could confer.The
they exchanged again those feelings and those promises that once had
previously seemed to secure everything, but that had been followed by so many
many years of division and estrangement.There they came back
again in the past, more delightfully happy, perhaps, in their
re-union, only when it had been screened for the first time; more tender, more
tried, more fixed in the knowledge of character, truth and
attachment; more equal to act, more justified in acting.And there, like
they slowly paced the gradual climb, carefree of each group around
them, seeing neither the wandering politicians, nor the animated housekeepers,
flirting girls, nursery nurses and children, they could indulge in
these retrospections and these thanks, and especially in those
explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment, which
were so poignant and so incessant in the interest.All the little one
the variations of the last week have been crossed; and yesterday and
today there could hardly be an end.She hadn't cheated on him.Mr. Elliot's jealousy had been the self-timer
the weight, the doubt, the torment.It had started to operate in the very
time of his first meeting in Bath; who had returned, after a short
suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him in
everything he had said and done, or failed to say and do, in the last
four twenty.He had gradually given in at best
hopes that his looks, words or actions occasionally encouraged; he
had been finally overcome by these feelings and these tones which
had reached her while she was speaking with Captain Harville; and under the
irresistible governance which he had seized with a sheet of paper, and
spilled his feelings.From what he then wrote, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.He persisted in having loved only her.She had never been
supplanted.He never even thought he saw her equal.So
much indeed, he was obliged to admit: that he had been constant
unconsciously, even involuntarily; that he wanted to forget it,
and I thought it was done.He had imagined himself indifferent, when
he had only been angry; and he had been unfair to his merits, because
he suffered from it.His character was now fixed on his
mind as perfection itself, now the finest way to
courage and gentleness; but he was obliged to admit that only
at Uppercross he had learned to do it justice, and it was not until Lyme that he had
started to understand each other.At Lyme he had received more lessons
that a kind.Mr. Elliot's fleeting admiration had at least elicited
him, and the scenes on the Cobb and Captain Harville's had fixed her
superiority.In her previous attempts to become attached to Louisa Musgrove (the
attempts at angry pride), he protested that he had forever
be impossible; that he didn't care, couldn't care about Louisa;
but until this day, until the leisure of reflection that followed
this, he had not understood the perfect excellence of the spirit with which
Louisa could stand a comparison so badly, or the unmatched perfect take
he had his.There he had learned to distinguish between
the firmness of the principle and the obstinacy of the personal will, between
the daring of recklessness and the resolve of a united mind.There
he had seen everything to exalt in his opinion the woman he had
lost; and he began to lament the pride, the madness, the madness of
resentment, which had kept him from trying to find her when he was thrown away
his way.From that time on his penance had become severe.It had not been earlier
free from the horror and remorse of the early days of
Louisa's accident, barely starting to feel alive again,
had started to feel, although alive, not at liberty.“I found,” he said, “that I was considered by Harville to be a fiancé!
That neither Harville nor his wife doubted our mutual
attachment.I was surprised and shocked.To some extent I could
contradict that instantly; but, when I started to think that the others
could have felt the same - her own family, maybe even herself - I was
more at my disposal.I was hers in honor if she wished.I had been unattended.I hadn't seriously thought about it
before.I hadn't thought that my excessive privacy should have its
danger of adverse consequences in many ways; and that I didn't have the right to be
trying to find out if I could get attached to either of the girls, to the
risk of raising even an unpleasant report, if there was no other
effects.I was totally wrong, and I have to bear the consequences."

In short, he found it too late that he had become entangled; and that
precisely when he became fully satisfied with not caring for Louisa at
everything, he must consider himself related to her, if her feelings for him
were what the Harvilles assumed.This determined him to leave Lyme, and
wait for his full recovery elsewhere.He would willingly weaken, by any
fair means, regardless of feelings or speculations about him
to exist; and so he went to his brother, that is to say after a while
to return to Kellynch and act according to the circumstances.“I was six weeks with Edward,” he said, “and I saw him happy..I could
has no other fun.I didn't deserve anything.He asked after you very
particularly; asked even if you were personally tampered with, few
suspecting that in my eyes you could never change."

Anne smiles and lets pass.It was too pleasant a mistake for one
reproach.It's something for a woman to be sure, in her
twenty-eight years old, that she hasn't lost a charm from earlier
youth; but the value of such a tribute has been inexpressibly increased to
Anne, comparing it to old words, and feeling it
result, not the cause of a renewal of his warm attachment.He had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own
pride, and blunders of his own calculations, until he is immediately released
of Louisa by her astonishing and happy intelligence
engagement with Benwick.“Here,” he said, “the worst of my condition is over; because now I could at least
put me on the path to happiness; I could practice; I could do
Something.But wait so long in inaction, and only wait
bad, had been terrible.In the first five minutes I said, `` I'm going
be in Bath Wednesday, 'and I was.Was it unforgivable to think so
is it worth the time to come? and come up with some hope? You
were single.It was possible that you retained the feelings of the
past, as I did; and an encouragement turned out to be mine.I could
never doubt that you would be loved and wanted by others, but I knew
a certainty that you had refused a man, at least, better
claims that me; and I couldn't help but say often, 'Was this
for me?'"

Their first meeting on Milsom Street had a lot to say, but the
concert even more.This evening seemed to be composed of exquisite
moments.The moment she stepped into the octagonal hall to
talk to her: the moment Mr. Elliot appears and tears her up
away, and one or two following moments, marked by the return of hope or
growing discouragement, were energetically inhabited."See you," he cried, in the midst of those who could not be my
sympathizers; to see your cousin near you, converse and smile,
and feel all the horrible eligibilities and properties of the match!
Consider it the sure wish of every being who could hope
influence you! Even if your own feelings were reluctant or
indifferent, considering what powerful support would be his! Was it
not enough to make a fool of myself to whom I appeared? How could i watch
on without agony? Wasn't that the very sight of the friend who sat behind
you, was not the memory of what had been, the knowledge of her
influence, the indelible and unchanging impression of what persuasion had
once done, wasn't it all against me?

"You should have distinguished", replied Anne.."You shouldn't have
suspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.If I was wrong to give in to persuasion once, remember it was for
persuasion on the side of security, not risk.When I gave in
I thought it was out of duty, but no duty could be called in to help here.In
marry a man indifferent to me, all risks would have been incurred,
and all duty violated."

“Maybe I should have reasoned thus,” he replied, “but I couldn't.I was not able to take advantage of the belated knowledge I had gained from
your character.I couldn't put it on the line; he was overwhelmed,
buried, lost in those earlier feelings I had been under
year after year.I could only think of you as someone who gave in, who
had abandoned me, who had been influenced by anyone rather than me.I saw you with the very person who guided you in that year of
misery.I had no reason to believe her less authority now.the
we had to add the force of habit."

"I would have thought," said Anne, "that my way of you
spared you a lot or all of that."

"No, no! Your manner may just be the ease with which your engagement
another man would give.I left you in this belief; and yet I was
determined to see you again.My spirits have rallied with the morning, and
I felt I still had a motive to stay here."

Finally, Anne was home again, and happier than anyone in this house.
could have conceived.All the surprise and suspense, and all the rest
painful part of the morning dispelled by this conversation, she
entered the house so happy that he was obliged to find an alloy in some
momentary apprehensions of its impossibility of lasting.Interval
of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best fix for
all that is dangerous in such refined bliss; and she went to her
room, and became steadfast and fearless in gratitude for his
enjoyment.Evening came, the living rooms were lit, the company
assembled.It was just a game of cards, it was just a mix of those who
had never met before, and those who met too often; a common place
belongings, too many for privacy, too small for variety; but Anne
had never found a shorter evening.Brilliant and charming in sensitivity
and happiness, and more generally admired than she thought or
neat, she had joyful or indulgent feelings for every creature
around her.Mr. Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.The Wallis, she had fun understanding them.Dame Dalrymple
and Miss Carteret - they would soon be harmless cousins ​​to her.It
didn't care about Mrs. Clay and had nothing to be ashamed of in public
the manners of his father and his sister.Along with the Musgroves there was the
happy chatter with perfect ease; with Captain Harville, the good heart
sexual intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell, attempts to
conversation, which a delicious conscience cut short; with the admiral
and Mrs. Croft, all of special cordiality and fervent interest,
that the same conscience sought to conceal; and with the captain
Wentworth, certain moments of communication occurring continuously, and
always the hope of more, and always the knowledge of his presence.It was in one of those short meetings, each apparently busy in
admiring a beautiful display of greenhouse plants, which she said ...

"I thought about the past and tried to judge impartially
good and bad, I mean as far as I'm concerned; and i have to believe
that I was right, as much as I suffered, that I was perfectly
right to be guided by the friend you will like better than you
do now.For me, she was in the place of a parent.Do not deceive me,
However.I'm not saying she wasn't mistaken in her advice.It was,
maybe, one of those cases where the advice is only good or bad insofar as
the event decides; and for me, I certainly should never, in any
circumstance of similarity tolerable, give such advice.But I mean
that I was right to submit to him, and that if I had done
otherwise, I should have suffered more by continuing the engagement
that I did not even give it up, because I should have suffered in my
consciousness.I have now, to the extent that such a feeling is admissible in
human nature, nothing to reproach me; and if I'm not mistaken, a
a strong sense of duty is not a bad part on a woman's part."

He looked at her, looked at Lady Russell, and looked at her again,
replied, as in a cold deliberation--

"Not yet.But there are hopes that she will be forgiven in time.I trust
soon be in charity with her.But I also thought about it
the past, and a question has arisen, if there is not
have you been a person my enemy even more than this lady? My own self.Tell me if, on my return to England in eight years, with a few
thousand pounds, and was sent to Laconia, if I had then written
to you, would you have replied to my letter? In short, would you like to have
renewed the commitment then? "

"Should I!" was his whole answer; but the accent was decisive enough."Good God!" he cried, you would! It's not that I haven't thought about it
she, or desires her, as what alone could crown all my other successes; but I
was proud, too proud to ask again.I did not understand you.I close
my eyes, and wouldn't understand you, or do you justice.It's a
memory that should make me forgive everyone sooner than
myself.Six years of separation and suffering could have been spared.It's also a kind of pain, which is new to me.I have been used to the
gratification to believe that I earn all the blessings that I
appreciated.I valued myself for honorable efforts and just rewards.Like other great men under the lapels, ”he added, with a smile.."I must
try to subdue my mind to my fortune.I must learn to be
happier than I deserve."



Chapter 24


Who can doubt what followed? When two young people take
the idea of ​​getting married, they are almost certain by the perseverance of
wear their point, whether they are always so poor, or always so reckless, or never
so unlikely to be necessary for the ultimate comfort of the other.It may be bad moral to conclude, but I think it is
truth; and if such games are successful, how would a Captain Wentworth and
an Anne Elliot, with the benefit of maturity of mind, conscience
of right, and an independent fortune between them, fail to bear
at each opposition? They might in fact have endured a great deal
treat more than they encountered, as there was not much to grieve them
beyond the lack of kindness and warmth.Sir Walter did not
objection, and Elizabeth has done nothing worse than looking cold and
indifferent.Captain Wentworth, with twenty-five thousand pounds,
and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him,
was no longer anyone.He was now considered quite worthy to address the
daughter of a foolish and spendthrift baronet, who had no
or enough sense to stay in the situation in which
Providence had placed him, and who could give his daughter now
but a small part of the ten thousand pound share that must be his
hereafter, thereafter.Sir Walter, indeed, although he had no affection for Anne, and no vanity
flattered, to make him truly happy on occasion, was very far from
thinking it's a bad match for her.On the contrary, when he saw more than
Captain Wentworth, saw him several times in the light of day, and looked at him closely,
he was very struck by his personal claims, and felt that his
the superiority of appearance may not be unfairly balanced against it
superiority of rank; and all this, helped by its eloquent name,
finally allowed Sir Walter to prepare his quill, with very good grace,
for the inclusion of marriage in the volume of honor.The only one of them, whose opposition of sentiment could excite any
severe anxiety was Lady Russell.Anne knew Lady Russell had to be
suffering from the pain of understanding and giving up on Mr. Elliot, and
make an effort to really familiarize yourself with, and do
justice to captain Wentworth.Yet this was what Lady Russell had
now to do.She must learn to feel that she was wrong with
regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in
each; that because Captain Wentworth's manners did not suit him
ideas, she had been too quick to suspect them to indicate a
dangerous impetuosity character; and this because Mr. Elliot
the manners had pleased him precisely in their propriety and their correctness,
their general politeness and their sweetness, she had been too quick
receive them as the sure result of the most just opinions and
well-regulated mind.There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do,
than to admit that she was completely wrong, and to resume
a new set of opinions and hopes.There is a speed of perception for some, a finesse in discernment
character, a natural penetration, in short, that no experience in
others may match, and Lady Russell had been less gifted in this part of
understanding that his young friend.But she was a very good woman,
and if his second object was to be reasonable and to judge well, his first
was to see Anne happy.She loved Anne better than she loved hers
capabilities; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over, found
little difficulty in attaching as a mother to the man who was
ensure the happiness of his other child.Of the whole family, Mary was probably the most immediately gratified
by the circumstance.It was honorable to have a married sister, and
she could boast of having greatly contributed to the
connection, keeping Anne with her in the fall; and like his
sister must be better than her husband's sisters, it was very nice
that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain
Benwick or Charles Hayter.Maybe she had something to suffer when
they reconnected, seeing Anne reestablished in the rights of
seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette; but she had a
future to look forward to, of mighty consolation.Anne did not have
Uppercross Hall before her, no land, no head of household;
and if they could prevent Captain Wentworth from being appointed baronet,
she wouldn't change the situation with Anne.It would be good for the older sister if she was also satisfied
with its situation, because a change is unlikely.She had
soon the mortification of seeing Mr. Elliot retire, and no one
good condition has since presented itself to raise even the
unfounded hopes that flowed with him.News of her cousin Anne's engagement broke on Mr. Elliot the most
unexpectedly.It disturbed his best domestic happiness plan, his
best hope to keep Sir Walter single by vigilance
the rights of the son-in-law would have given.But, although taken aback and
disappointed, he could still do something for his own sake and his
own pleasure.He soon left Bath; and on Mrs. Clay to leave him
shortly thereafter, and then be heard as established under its
protection in London, it was obvious how double a match he had been
play, and how determined he was to avoid being cut
by a shrewd woman, at least.Mrs. Clay's affections had dominated her interest, and she had
sacrificed, for the love of the young man, the possibility of plotting
longer for Sir Walter.She has abilities, however, as well as
ailments; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or
his can finally win; if, after having prevented her from
being the wife of Sir Walter, he cannot be cajoled and fondled to
for the last time by making her the wife of Sir William.There is no doubt that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and
mortified by the loss of their companion and the discovery of their
deception in her.They had their big cousins, of course, to resort to
to for comfort; but they must long feel that in order to flatter and follow
others, without being flattered and followed in their turn, is only a state of
half-pleasure.Anne, very early satisfied with the meaning of Lady Russell
love Captain Wentworth like she should, had no other alloy
happiness of its prospects than what is born from the consciousness of
having no relationship to confer on him that a man of sense could value.There she felt very keenly her own inferiority.The disproportion in
their fortune was nothing; that did not give him a moment of regret; But
have no family to receive it and estimate it correctly, nothing
respectability, harmony, goodwill to offer in return for all
value and all the prompt reception that met her in her brothers and
sisters, was a source of pain as keen as his mind could possibly be
sensitive under circumstances of otherwise strong bliss.She had
but two friends in the world to add to his list, Lady Russell and Mrs
Black-smith.To these, however, he was very willing to attach himself.Lady Russell, despite all his past transgressions, he could now
value of his heart.If he didn't have to say he believed
she had been right to divide them originally, he was ready to say
almost everything else in her favor, and as for Mrs. Smith, she had
claims of all kinds to recommend it quickly and permanently.His recent good offices through Anne had sufficed on their own, and
their marriage, instead of depriving her of a friend, made her secure
of them.She was their first visitor in their sedentary life; and captain
Wentworth, putting her on the path to her husband's recovery
property in the Antilles, by writing for it, by acting for it, and
seeing her through all the little difficulties of the affair with the
the activity and effort of an intrepid man and a determined friend, fully
rendered the services which she had rendered or which she had never intended to render,
to his wife.Mrs. Smith's enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement in income,
with some improvement in health, and the acquisition of such friends for
be with them often, because his cheerfulness and quick-wittedness did not fail
her; and while these premium supplies remained, she could have
to challenge even larger memberships of worldly prosperity.It
could have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy, and yet be
happy.Her source of bliss was in the glow of her spirits, as she
friend Anne was in the warmth of her heart.Anne was tenderness
himself, and she had all the worth in Captain Wentworth's
affection.His profession was all that could make his friends
Wish less for this tenderness, the fear of a future war all that could weaken
its sun.She prided herself on being the wife of a sailor, but she had to pay
the early warning tax for belonging to this profession which is, if
possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its
national significance.Finished
